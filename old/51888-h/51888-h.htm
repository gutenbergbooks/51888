<h2>NOTE.</h2>

<p>This little work was published in England several
years ago; but has never before been republished in
this country. It deals with those texts of Scripture
which have generally been supposed to foretell the destruction
of the material universe; and shows conclusively
that these passages have been entirely misunderstood
by commentators; and that, rightly interpreted,
they have no reference whatever to the outer realm
of matter, but to the inner realm of mind; to the
internal condition of the church, the loss or destruction
of heavenly charity, and the eclipse of genuine
faith, which it was foreseen and foretold would occur at
the close of the first Christian Dispensation.</p>

<p>It is proper to add, also, that, although the name of
Swedenborg nowhere occurs in the book, it is evident
that the author was familiar with his teachings, and
viewed and treated his subject from the Swedenborgian
<span class="pagenum">{6}</span>
stand-point. But with the lovers of spiritual truth and
the seekers after a Spiritual Christianity, this fact&mdash;now
that so many earnest inquirers are beginning to read the
writings of the Swedish seer&mdash;will rather add to than
detract from the interest and value of the work.</p>

<h2><span class="small">THE</span><br />
      NEW ESCHATOLOGY.</h2>

<p id="revquote"><i>For the first heaven and the first earth were passed<br />
away; and there was no more sea</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rev.</span> xxi. 1.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">While</span> we blame the conduct of the Jews in adhering
only to the literal sense of the Scriptures, and
by such adherence rejecting their Messiah, we possibly forget
that the Christian church has followed precisely the
same line of conduct; and that to this we are indebted for
the greater part of those absurd dogmas, which have so long
exposed the Gospel to the derision of its enemies. Had
men properly discriminated between those parts of the Sacred
Volume which are <i>literally</i> true, and those which are
only <i>apparently</i> so, we should never have heard of the doctrines
of transubstantiation and Roman supremacy; nor of
many other equally absurd beliefs which the generality of
Christians entertain. We should not have seen a fallible
and weak mortal exalted as Head over the church of God;
we should not have heard of a morsel of bread being
changed into the Lord's body; we should not have seen the
<span class="pagenum">{8}</span>
Divine Nature divided among three separate and distinct
Persons; nor should we have heard of the doctrine which
we are about to bring under consideration.</p>

<p>But do not mistake me. When I assert that the Scriptures
in the literal sense sometimes speak only apparent
truth, I by no means deny the divine authority of the Sacred
Record. The church whose doctrines I advocate, most
explicitly declares that the <i>whole</i> of the Scriptures,&mdash;every
chapter,&mdash;every verse,&mdash;every word, nay, sometimes every
<i>letter</i>&mdash;is filled with the inbreathed wisdom of God. But
when I say that apparent and not <i>real</i> truths are often
laid down in the letter of the Word, I affirm what every
man who possesses any share of discernment will readily
admit. The fact itself is too plain even to require proof.
Thus we read that the sun rises, moves, and sets; which is
certainly true in <i>appearance</i>, but not in reality. Again we
are told that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> repents,&mdash;that He is weary, and
that He turns away His face from man; which, though correct
as regards appearance, has no foundation in literal
fact; for though the Sun of Righteousness is said to rise
upon the soul, and to set when the mind is given up to evil,
yet it is here as in the case of the <i>material</i> sun. In God
"there is no variableness nor shadow of turning;"&mdash;"He
fainteth not, neither is <i>weary</i>;"&mdash;"He is not a man that
He should lie, nor the son of man that He should repent;"
but as the earth, by turning to or from the sun, causes the
appearance of motion in that body; so the mind of man,
by turning to the Lord, or by departing from Him, causes
<span class="pagenum">{9}</span>
an appearance of change in God; yet it is not He that
changes, but the mind itself.</p>

<p>And we may go still further. There are numerous passages
in the Word of God, which in the literal sense only,
do not convey even <i>apparent</i> truth. Among others the following,
"Thou ridest through them with thine horses." "He
rode upon a cherub and did fly; He came flying upon the
wings of the wind." "He that eateth my flesh and drinketh
my blood, dwelleth in me and I in him;" "for my flesh is
meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed." "This (bread)
is my body; this cup is the New Testament in my blood."
"If thy right hand offend thee, cut it off and cast it from
thee." I am the Door of the sheep." "I am the true
vine, and my Father is the Husbandman." In all these
passages, and others which will occur to every reader of
the Scripture, the literal sense conveys neither real nor apparent
truth. The Lord does not really ride through the
sea, nor does he even <i>appear</i> to do so. The flesh of the
Saviour was not to be <i>literally</i> eaten. The bread which He
held was not really his body, nor did it even <i>seem</i> to be so.
And as in these and similar instances, the outward letter of
the Word conveys not its true meaning, it is to be sought
for in the law of correspondence; or in that eternal connection
which subsists between natural things and spiritual.</p>

<p>And upon this law of correspondence or analogy I must
make a few preliminary remarks. It is what the world in
general terms <i>figure</i>, or <i>metaphor</i>; but the New Church
makes a distinction, and I will add, a very just one, betwixt
<span class="pagenum">{10}</span>
<i>figure</i> (properly so called) and <i>correspondence</i>. Figurative
language is that in which a comparison is drawn
between one natural object and another; the analogy between
which exists only in the imagination, and has, therefore,
no <i>real</i> existence: but correspondence is the representation
of spiritual things by natural; and the resemblance
is not merely imaginary but real, consisting in the proper
dependence of the latter upon the former, as an effect upon
its cause. If we compare a mighty empire in its rise,
glory, and decline, to an oak springing up, flourishing for
centuries, and then decaying, we use <i>figurative</i> language;
since both the empire and the oak are <i>natural</i> objects, which
have no <i>real</i> connection with each other, and between which
the resemblance is only imaginary. But when the Creator
is likened to the sun, the language is no longer <i>figurative</i>
but <i>correspondent</i>. It is not the comparison of earthly
things with earthly, but of spiritual things with natural.
And the objects compared have a real connection with each
other, since the material sun depends on its Creator as an
effect upon its cause. Again, when the church is described
as the Lord's body, the language is correspondent and the
connection real; for the rise and prosperity of the church
depended upon the assumption of humanity by the Saviour;
and it still hangs upon it as the cause of its existence.</p>

<p>We further notice that all passages of the Word, the
historical as well as the poetical, bear within them such a
correspondent or internal sense. This will be placed beyond
a reasonable doubt if we consider, first, that "all Scripture,"
<span class="pagenum">{11}</span>
whether historical or prophetic, is, according to the
Apostle, inspired or <i>God-breathed</i>. And as the breath of
God is the infinitude of his love and wisdom, every portion
of the sacred Volume must be filled with it. Not only
every book in general, but every verse and every sentence;&mdash;for
if we can find a single sentence which does not
contain within itself the infinite wisdom of God, such sentence
must either form no part of the Scripture, or the
assertion of Paul must be untrue. And secondly, the Word
of God from the beginning to the end is intended to "make
us wise unto salvation." This is the design with which
every part of it was written. But we can only become
truly wise by being acquainted with our own state, and
with the nature of the Divine Redeemer. Whatever part,
therefore, does not relate both to God and to ourselves, cannot
communicate saving wisdom; and consequently, (if the
Apostle be correct,) cannot form any portion of the Sacred
Volume. Now, independently of the passages which we
have before quoted, the greater part of what is called "the
historical Word," consists, in its mere <i>outward form</i>, of the
records of the Jewish nation, their wars, and their policy.
The prophecies themselves in their literal and obvious
meaning, refer to the rise and decline of earthly states, and
to the mutation of earthly empires. Either, then, such
records and prophecies must have an internal and correspondent
meaning, relating to spiritual and divine things,
or if they have not, they cannot be fitted to communicate
saving wisdom, and so cannot be accounted part of the
<span class="pagenum">{12}</span>
Scriptures; seeing that the <i>Scriptures</i> in every part, are,
according to Paul, filled with this wisdom.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_1" id="Ref_1" href="#Foot_1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>If, then, there <i>are</i> parts of the Word of God, the true
meaning of which is not to be found in the literal sense;
if that Word contains, within the outward letter, a spiritual
and internal meaning; and if we are to resort to such
meaning where the letter gives not the true one; the next
inquiry which arises is, How are we to determine when a
passage is true in the literal sense, or when it is only true
in the corresponding one? The answer is easy. When
the outward meaning of any passage asserts something at
variance with reason,&mdash;or when it appears opposed to the
known character of God, then such meaning must be
abandoned, and the truth sought in the internal sense.
This answer has been admitted as correct by the Protestant
churches, in their contest with their Catholic neighbors.
The latter argue that the words of our Lord, "This is my
body," are to be literally understood; while the former
very justly answer that, since such an interpretation is
opposed to reason and at variance with the nature of God
as a God of truth, it ought to be and must be rejected;
and the words considered as <i>figurative</i>, or as I have already
termed it, <i>correspondent</i>.</p>

<p>I have now proved a few preliminary points: <i>First</i>, that
there are some portions of the Word of God, the true
<span class="pagenum">{13}</span>
meaning of which is not to be found in the letter. <i>Second</i>,
that when the literal sense of a passage is opposed to fact
and reason, such literal sense is to be rejected. And <i>third</i>,
that in such cases the interpretation must be sought in the
correspondent or figurative meaning.</p>

<p>We turn now to what is commonly denominated "the
End of the World;" and on stating the generally received
doctrine on this subject, we shall quote the words of the
celebrated John Wesley, both on account of his piety and
learning, and because the views which he maintains may
be fairly taken as those of the generality of Christians.
First he observes:</p>

<p>"There shall be earthquakes, not in divers places only,
but in <i>all places</i>; not in one part only, but in every part of
the habitable world. In one of these every island shall
flee away, and the mountains will not be found. Meanwhile
all the waters of the terraqueous globe will feel the
violence of these concussions. The sea and the waves
roaring, with such an agitation as had never been known
before since the hour that `the fountains of the great deep
were broken up' to destroy the earth, which then stood
'out of the water and in the water!' The air will be all
storm and tempest, full of dark vapors, and pillars of
smoke resounding with thunder from pole to pole, and torn
with ten thousand lightnings. But the commotion will not
stop in the region of the air: the powers of heaven also
shall be shaken. 'There shall be signs in the sun and in
the moon, and in the stars;' those fixed as well as those
<span class="pagenum">{14}</span>
that move round them. 'The sun shall be turned into
darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and
terrible day of the Lord come.' 'The stars shall withdraw
their shining,' yea, and 'fall from heaven,' being thrown
out of their orbits. And then shall be heard the universal
<i>shout</i> from all the companies of heaven, followed by the
<i>voice of the archangel</i>, proclaiming the approach of the Son
of God and man; and the <i>trumpet of God</i> sounding an
alarm to all that sleep in the dust of the earth. In consequence
of this, all the graves shall open and the bodies of
men arise."</p>

<p>After the following judgment, (which Mr. Wesley thinks
must last several thousand years, considering "the number
of persons who are to be judged, and of actions which are
to be inquired into,") he proceeds:</p>

<p>"Then the heavens will be shriveled up as a parchment
scroll, and pass away with a great noise. The very manner
of their passing away is disclosed to us by the apostle Peter,
'In the day of God, the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved.'
The whole beautiful fabric will be overthrown by
that raging element, the connexion of all its parts destroyed,
and every atom torn asunder from the others. 'By the
same the earth also and the works that are therein, shall be
burnt up;' the enormous work of nature, the everlasting
hills, mountains that have defied the rage of time, and
stood unmoved so many thousand years, will sink down in
fiery ruin. How much less will the works of art, though
of the most durable kind, the utmost efforts of human industry,
<span class="pagenum">{15}</span>
tombs, pillars, triumphal arches, castles, pyramids,
be able to withstand the flaming Conqueror! All, all will
die, perish, vanish away, like a dream when one awaketh."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_2" id="Ref_2" href="#Foot_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Such, in substance, is the doctrine of the Christian world;
and certainly if <i>fear</i> and <i>terror</i> were sufficient to drive men
into a state of righteousness, here are horrors enough to
excite the fears even of the most courageous. But not the
eloquence of man any more than his wrath, worketh the righteousness
of God. It is not sufficient that a doctrine be eloquently
set forth; it must also have truth for its foundation.
It is not enough that Scripture be quoted to support
it; that Scripture must also stand in its proper connexion,
and retain its proper meaning; for if this be not the case,
however eloquent the preacher and however numerous the
apparent proofs, the tenet can only rank with that "wood,
hay, and stubble,"&mdash;those unsubstantial and airy doctrines,
which, when tried by the fire of Divine Wisdom, are consumed
and pass away. And if we can prove, <i>First</i>, That
the passages which are quoted to support the doctrine before
us, are <i>literally</i> understood, while nevertheless such literal
sense leads to absurdity; <i>Second</i>, If we can further
make it appear that such a <i>literal</i> application of them makes
them inconsistent with each other as well as with many
plain portions of the Bible; and again, that, even if we
admit such outward meaning to be correct, it gives no countenance
<span class="pagenum">{16}</span>
to the doctrine in dispute; while at the same time
that doctrine is opposed to the end of creation and the
character of God;&mdash;if these propositions can be made good,
I trust it will appear, that the tenet itself has no countenance
from the Scriptures; and that the true meaning of
the passages adduced, must be sought for in the internal or
spiritual sense of the Word.</p>

<p>The portions of Scripture on which the supposed destruction
of the universe is founded, are far from numerous.
Some of them are already quoted in the extract from Mr.
Wesley; and previous to entering upon the consideration
of our first proposition, we shall point out a few of the remainder.
"Immediately after the tribulation of those
days, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not
give her light, the stars shall fall from heaven, and the
powers of heaven shall be shaken; and then shall appear
the sign of the Son of man in heaven; and then shall all the
tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man
coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
And He shall send his angels with a great sound of a
trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the
four winds, from one end of heaven to the other." Matt.
xxiv.&nbsp;29, 30, 31. "Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or
one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, until all be
fulfilled." Matt. v.&nbsp;18. "Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye
gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus who is taken
from you, shall so come as ye have seen Him go into
heaven." Acts i.&nbsp;11. "Then cometh the end, when he
<span class="pagenum">{17}</span>
shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the
Father." 1 Cor. xv.&nbsp;24. "The Lord Jesus shall be revealed
from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire,
taking vengeance on them that know not God." 2 Thess. i.&nbsp;7, 8.
"The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the
night, in which the heavens shall pass away with a great
noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat; the
earth also, and the works that are therein shall be burned
up." 2 Peter iii.&nbsp;10.</p>

<p>But it is from the book of Revelation, that the principal
part of the proofs are drawn. A book <i>confessedly</i> figurative
in its language, and which the wisest and most learned
men have in vain striven to interpret. One could hardly
commit or imagine a greater outrage upon the common
sense of mankind, than that which the defenders of this
doctrine have committed, by first confessing the Book itself
to be figurative and inexplicable, and then adducing its
language <i>literally</i>, in their support, as if they had all at
once found out that it was no longer figurative but <i>literal</i>.
If the visions of the Apostle are not literal, but grand and
representative images, then ought they not to be understood
in a literal manner, or if they are to be so understood,
then as plain and literal narrative they may be easily
explained; and the complaint which the receivers of this
doctrine have so often made, that it cannot be understood,
is to the last degree frivolous and foolish.</p>

<p>And what makes the matter still worse is, that the passages
they have adduced are among the most highly figurative
<span class="pagenum">{18}</span>
in the Apostle's descriptions. The following are among
them: "Behold He cometh with clouds, and every eye
shall see Him; and they that pierced Him; and all the
tribes of the earth shall wail because of Him." i.&nbsp;7. "And
I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and lo, there
was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth
of hair, and the moon became as blood, and the
stars of heaven fell unto the earth; even as a fig-tree casteth
her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind;
and the heaven departed as a scroll, when it is rolled together,
and every mountain and island were moved out of
their places." vi.&nbsp;12, 13, 14. "And I saw a great white
throne, and Him that sat on it, from whose face the earth
and the heaven fled away, and there was found no place for
them: and I saw the dead, small and great, stand before
God." xx.&nbsp;11, 12. "And I saw a new heaven and a new
earth, for the first heaven and the first earth were passed
away, and there was no more sea." xxi.&nbsp;1.</p>

<p>Such are the texts of Scripture by which the doctrine
before us is supported; the greater part of which have
clearly no reference to the subject, and the remainder being
not the literal language of narrative, but the <i>correspondent</i>
and mysterious words of prophecy. Yet, even viewing
them in their outward meaning, we can scarcely fail to be
struck with the wide difference which exists between them
and the description of Mr. Wesley. There is nothing in
them of an earthquake, amidst some general concussion in
which every island shall flee away:&mdash;nothing of "the air
<span class="pagenum">{19}</span>
resounding with thunder from pole to pole, and being torn
with ten thousand lightnings:"&mdash;nothing of the connexion
of every part being destroyed, and every atom torn asunder
from the others. We may therefore fairly set these down
as additional horrors, supplied by the imagination of the
writer, and unsupported by anything like Scripture proof.
And with regard to what remains, we will now see how far
that <i>literal</i> sense upon which it rests, will stand the criterion
by which we are to determine the meaning of Scripture.
If the outward meaning is reasonable and consistent,
then it must be adhered to, and the doctrine is established:
but if, on the other hand, such interpretation leads
to absurdity, then, by the consent of every Protestant
church, that meaning must be laid aside; and with it, too,
must be cast off the tenet of this world's destruction.</p>

<p>But one cautionary remark must here be made. We
are by no means authorized to mingle together literal and
figurative language. That is, we have no right to interpret
one part of a sentence literally, and another as figure.
The passages before us are either <i>literal</i>, or they are <i>not</i>.
If they <i>are</i>, then every part of them must be literally understood;
if they are <i>not</i>, then no part of them can be literally
interpreted. If, then, we adhere to the outward
meaning, we must carry that adherence to every portion of
the text; for if we reject such meaning in any part, we
reject it in the whole; and the doctrine which depends for
support upon it, must fall to the ground.</p>

<p>Keeping this in view our first proposition is, that, to affix
<span class="pagenum">{20}</span>
a literal sense to the passages before us, is to give them a
meaning at once absurd and unreasonable. We might in
proof of this, go through every word in every text. It is
declared in the letter that "the Lord shall <i>descend</i> from
heaven;" but heaven is not a place connected either by
height or distance with the material world. Could we rise
far into the regions of space, and ascend for ever in the
oceans of worlds, still, as regards <i>distance</i>, we should be no
nearer heaven than before. Where God manifests Himself
in the fullness of his love, there is heaven; but God being
a Spirit, can only manifest Himself thus in a spiritual
region; and such a region has no relation of space or distance
with a world of matter. Hence, therefore, a descent
from heaven is not a literal going down from a higher place
to one beneath, and consequently must not be <i>literally</i> understood.
Here the literal meaning fails at the very
threshold. At the first step we are obliged to seek for a
figurative or spiritual sense.</p>

<p>If we overcome <i>this</i> difficulty, we have yet to encounter
others. It is further said that He shall descend with "a
trumpet." Now modern Christians ridicule the idea of
visible habitations and outward objects in the spiritual
world. What then are we to make of the description before
us,&mdash;of this <i>trumpet</i> with which the Lord is to descend?
Is it <i>material</i>, or is it <i>not</i>? If it is material, then heaven,
in which there are material objects, must be a material
<i>place</i>; and the Being who uses this material trumpet, must
be a material Being; consequently, we must materialize
<span class="pagenum">{21}</span>
both heaven and its inhabitants. But if this trumpet is
not a <i>material</i> one, then let the defenders of the literal
meaning tell us what is a spiritual trumpet? Whatever
may be the answer, one thing is certain,&mdash;that which is
spiritual is <i>internal</i>; and if by the words before us we are
not to understand a literal trumpet, but something spiritual
signified by it, then the literal meaning of the passage is
not and cannot be the true one.</p>

<p>It is further declared that "The Lord shall come in the
clouds of heaven." The question again arises: What are
we to understand by these? The clouds literally mean
those masses of vapor, which, arising from the earth, are
condensed and become visible in the atmosphere; and
which surround the earth at the distance of a few miles.
If we keep to the literal sense of the passage, these must
be understood. But is it in these that the Lord is to descend?
Is six or eight miles above the surface of the
globe, heaven? Or can bodies which seldom rise beyond
this elevation, be properly called the clouds of heaven?
Or is this the glory with which the Lord is to be invested&mdash;the
vapors which rise from the material globe?</p>

<p>But this is not all. With Him the angels are also to
descend. Now the nature of angels is not material; they
exist not in space, nor are they included in its boundaries.
How, then, we again ask, are spiritual beings to descend in
a <i>material</i> vapor? It would degrade the subject to carry
these questions further; but every person's discernment will
enable him to perceive that by no means can the <i>literal</i>
<span class="pagenum">{22}</span>
clouds be understood; and that these words must, like the
former, be acknowledged as <i>figurative</i>. Here, therefore, at
the very commencement we are obliged to <i>spiritualize</i> both
the <i>descent</i>, the <i>trumpet</i>, and the <i>clouds</i>. Do what we will,
the literal sense is absurd. And if we are forced to allow
that <i>part</i> of the description cannot be literally understood,
it is fair to conclude that the remainder has also an <i>internal</i>
meaning.</p>

<p>We shall soon perceive further proof of this. After it is
declared that the Lord shall come "in the clouds of
heaven," it is added, as a necessary consequence, "and
then shall <i>all the tribes of the earth</i> mourn, when they <i>see</i>
the Son of Man coming in the clouds." In agreement with
this are the words of John, "Behold, He cometh <i>with
clouds</i>; and <i>every eye</i> shall see Him." If this be understood
of an event which is literally to take place, we must again
believe an impossibility. This world is a <i>round</i> body; and
that which is visible to the inhabitants of one hemisphere,
must be invisible to the dwellers on the other. Those who
live upon one part of its surface cannot, by any possibility,
see what is above the opposite part. This is a circumstance
of daily experience:&mdash;at twelve o'clock at midnight the
sun is visible to the inhabitants of the other side of this
earth, and with them it is noon-day; but at that hour it is
invisible to us; nor can we, by any possible means, obtain
a sight of it. If, then, it be true that an object visible on
one side of a globe, is invisible on the opposite, we inquire,
In what situation must the Lord appear, that He may be
<span class="pagenum">{23}</span>
seen at one and the same moment from <i>every part</i> of a
round body? Where, or in what part of the atmosphere
must He be placed that <i>all the tribes of the earth</i>, (those on
its <i>opposite sides</i>,) may behold Him at the same time? Such
a position is not only difficult, but absolutely impossible, unless
the figure of the globe were changed; and to believe
that such will be the manner of our Lord's coming, is to
involve ourselves in a labyrinth of absurdities.</p>

<p>Aware of this difficulty, the writer whom I have already
quoted supposes that the inhabitants of this earth will be
caught up in the air, and <i>thus</i> be enabled to behold our
Lord's descent. "Perhaps," says he, "it is more agreeable
to our Lord's own account of his coming in the clouds,
to suppose it will be above the earth, if not 'twice a planetary
height;' and this supposition is not a little favored by
what St. Paul writes to the Thessalonians, 'The dead in
Christ shall rise first.' Then we who remain alive shall be
caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord
in the air. So that it seems most probable, the 'great white
throne' will be exalted high above the earth." Such a
method of explanation only shows the difficulties into
which the mere literal sense has thrown its followers. Independent
of the total absence of all Scripture proof of
these ideas, it may be remarked that, "twice a planetary
height," that is, twice the distance of the farthest planet
from the earth, is not the place of clouds; in such case,
therefore, the Lord would not come <i>in</i> the clouds, but far
<i>above</i> them. Nor could He be said to descend <i>from</i> heaven;
<span class="pagenum">{24}</span>
for as heaven, in the literal sense, is the starry region, if He
remained stationary in that region, it would not be a descent
<i>from</i> heaven, but a descent <i>in</i> heaven. And besides,
as the clouds, literally, are the vapors surrounding the
earth, by interpreting them to mean "twice a planetary
height," the literal sense is given up; and if this be rejected,
the doctrine before us is overthrown.</p>

<p>Once more we turn to the texts. Another event which
is said to accompany the coming of the Lord, is the falling
of the stars from heaven to the earth. "The stars shall
fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven shall be
shaken." "The stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even
as a fig-tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken
of a mighty wind." When, in disputing with the Romish
church, we contend that the Lord's words are not to be
understood <i>literally</i>, we think it sufficient to prove, that so
understood they involve an absurdity. But fully as great
an absurdity is involved in the literal interpretation of the
words before us. The stars, though to us they appear but
as shining atoms, are proved beyond the possibility of
doubt, to be equal to our sun both in size and splendor.
Each one of them is, in fact, a <i>sun</i>, as large and as brilliant
as that which enlightens our day. Now the sun exceeds
our earth nearly ten hundred thousand times in magnitude;
<i>each</i> star, therefore, may be reasonably supposed
to exceed the size of this globe nearly a million times.
As well, then, may we talk of ten thousand worlds falling
upon an atom, as of ten thousand suns, each of them a
<span class="pagenum">{25}</span>
million times larger than the globe, falling upon this grain
of earth: it is in itself as impossible as for a piece of bread
to become the body of the Lord.</p>

<p>But further; the <i>number</i> of these bodies is beyond the
power of human calculation. Millions sink into nothing
in computing it,&mdash;<i>thousands</i> of millions are nothing. Every
part of the vault of heaven contains myriads; and clusters
of them have been observed which contain, within themselves,
myriads more. Could we penetrate into the depths
of space, as far as the eye could see&mdash;as far as thought
could penetrate, we should find suns and worlds till the
mind was lost in the idea of their multitude: and though
we continued to move onward for ages, we should still find
ourselves but on the threshold of creation. These are not
the visions of speculation, but the facts of philosophy;&mdash;truths
which actual observation has placed beyond a doubt.
Such are, literally, the stars of heaven: myriads of myriads
of suns, surrounded by ten thousand times ten thousand
worlds. And let the common sense of mankind
decide, whether all these can fall upon the surface of a
globe not equal to the smallest of them in magnitude.</p>

<p>But we have not yet done with this subject. Let us
imagine it possible that these innumerable and enormous
bodies <i>were</i> thrown out of their stations, and by the hand
of God launched towards our little world. What would
result if they only came within a short distance of it? (to
say nothing of their falling upon its surface.) It is well
known to all who are acquainted with philosophy, that each
<span class="pagenum">{26}</span>
of the heavenly bodies possesses a power called attraction,
by which it draws towards itself any smaller body that
comes within its sphere. So powerful is this attractive
force that the sun alone draws all the worlds which move
around it, and keeps them from flying off, though some are
at the distance of eighteen hundred millions of miles!
Each of the stars being of the same nature with our sun,
possesses equally this attracting power. And were only
a few of these bodies to be brought within a certain distance
of the earth, the force of their combined attraction
acting in contrary directions, would explode and scatter
abroad, not only this earth but every earth in the system:
and long before they could fall upon its surface, there would
be no world for them to fall upon; it would be dissolved,
and its atoms scattered through the universe.</p>

<p>Again, the Apostle Peter declares that "The heavens
shall pass away with a great noise, and <i>the elements</i> shall
<i>melt</i> with fervent heat." A question, therefore, once more
arises, what is meant by "the elements?" Literally, they
signify the most simple forms of matter, fire, air, earth,
and water. But how can these melt, or be melted?&mdash;Can
<i>fire</i> melt with fervent heat? It may be dispersed in its
pure form, that of heat or caloric; but it is incapable of
being melted. Can air, then, melt? It may be expanded,
but it will not <i>melt</i>, in the literal meaning of the word.
Can water melt? It may be raised in steam, and made to
fly off in vapor: it may, by the application of heat, be
resolved into air, its first principle; but it will not melt.
<span class="pagenum">{27}</span>
There is, therefore, only one element out of the four which
is capable of being literally melted; <i>earth may</i>, indeed, be
vitrified, and rendered fluid. But how can <i>one element</i> be
denominated <i>the elements</i>? And besides, the apostle seems
to exclude the <i>earth</i> from the elements which are thus to
melt; for he mentions <i>its</i> destruction, as subsequent to that
of the elements. "The elements shall melt with fervent
heat, the <i>earth also</i>", that is, in addition to these, the earth
and the works that are therein, shall be burned up.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_3" id="Ref_3" href="#Foot_3">[3]</a></span>
Here again, the literal sense fails. We must either allow what
is not true, namely, that <i>fire</i>, <i>air</i>, and <i>water</i>, can be melted
by fire, or seek for an internal and figurative meaning.</p>

<p>I might pass thus through the whole of the language on
which this tenet is founded; and it would be easy to show
that the circumstances are as impossible in their literal
meaning, as that a man should eat "the flesh of his own
arm," or that our Lord should literally be a <i>vine</i> and a <i>door</i>.</p>

<p>The very advocates of the doctrine are convinced of this.
Hence they have framed various and contradictory systems
to explain the above descriptions. One has asserted that
<span class="pagenum">{28}</span>
the earth will at that period <i>be rolled out</i> of her orbit, and
that this motion will cause an appearance as if the heavens
passed away. Another has enveloped the world in a thick
mist, by which the light of the moon, being changed, will
appear of a red color. A third has appointed a comet,
which in its passage to or from the sun, will approach this
earth and involve it in flames. All have seen the difficulties,
and all have attempted to overcome them by explanations;
yet, after all, the task remains as arduous as
ever. If we will, in despite of reason, found a doctrine on
the literal meaning of the texts, we must adhere to that
meaning; for to depart from it, is to confess its insufficiency:
and if, on the other hand, we resolve to reject the
literal sense in <i>one part</i>, we then acknowledge that it is not
the true one, and that another must be sought for. If we
are obliged to give up a literal falling of stars to the earth,
and a literal appearance in the clouds of the air, then we
must give up also, a literal burning and destruction of the
universe; for if one part of the sentence is to be understood
figuratively, so is the other.</p>

<p>And that such destruction is a spiritual event, and not a
natural one, will appear still further from the following observation.
When two prophecies are found, couched in the
same language, and nearly in the same words, one of which
prophecies has been fulfilled, while the other yet remains to
be accomplished; the manner in which the latter will be
fulfilled must be determined by the previous fulfillment of
the former.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{29}</span>
Now it is a fact, although very seldom noticed, that the
prophecies relating to the <i>first</i> coming of the Lord, are expressed
in the very same language with those which relate
to his second appearance. We need only turn to the writings
of the prophets to be convinced of this. "Behold,"
says Malachi, "the day cometh that shall <i>burn as an oven</i>,
and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly shall be as
stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith
<span class="smcap">Jehovah of Hosts</span>. And, behold, I send you Elijah the
prophet, before the coming of the <i>great and terrible day</i> of
the Lord." iv.&nbsp;1, 5. Again, Isaiah: "All the host of
heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled
together as a scroll, and all their host shall fall down as a
falling fig from the fig-tree.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_4" id="Ref_4" href="#Foot_4">[4]</a></span>
Every battle of the warrior
is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but
this shall be with <i>burning</i> and <i>fuel of fire</i>. For unto us a
child is born." ix.&nbsp;5. "Upon the servants and upon the
handmaids in those days I will pour out my spirit; and I
will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth, <i>blood</i>,
and <i>fire</i>, and vapor of smoke. <i>The sun shall be turned into</i>
<span class="pagenum">{30}</span>
<i>darkness</i> and <i>the moon into blood</i> before the great and terrible
day of the Lord come." Joel ii.&nbsp;29-31.</p>

<p>This latter prophecy is expressly applied by Peter to the
commencement of Christianity. In defending his brethren
from the charge of imposture brought against them by the
Jews on the day of Pentecost, he declares, "This (the extraordinary
inspiration of the spirit) is that which was
spoken by the prophet Joel; I will show wonders in the
heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath, blood, and
fire, and vapor of smoke. The sun shall be turned into
darkness, and the moon into blood." Acts ii.&nbsp;16-20.</p>

<p>Once more, the prophet Haggai, speaking of the same
period declares, "Thus saith Jehovah of hosts. Yet once
it is a little while and I will shake the heavens and the
earth and the sea and the dry land, and I will shake all
nations and the desire of all nations shall come, and I will
fill this house (the latter temple) with glory, saith Jehovah
of hosts." Again, the prophet Joel before quoted, says,
"Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision; for the
<i>day of the</i> Lord is near in the valley of decision. <i>The sun</i>
and <i>the moon shall be darkened</i>, and the stars shall withdraw
their shining. The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> also shall roar out of Zion, and
utter his voice from Jerusalem, and the heavens and the
earth shall shake: but the Lord will be the hope of his
people. So shall ye know that I am the Lord your God,
dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain. Then shall Jerusalem
be holy." iii.&nbsp;14-17. "But who (says Malachi,) may
abide the day of His coming, or who shall stand when He
<span class="pagenum">{31}</span>
appeareth? for He is like a refiner's <i>fire</i> and like fullers'
soap." And to conclude this magnificent imagery, Isaiah
declares, "Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth;
and the former shall not be remembered nor come to mind;&mdash;they
shall not hunger, nor thirst, neither shall the heat
of the sun smite them; but He that hath mercy upon them
shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall He guide
them."</p>

<p>With such descriptions of the first Advent of the Messiah
do the prophets abound. Let any one peruse with attention
the writings of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Zechariah, Joel,
Haggai, and Malachi, and he will be convinced of the
truth of this remark. We will now notice the agreement
which exists between these prophecies relating to his first
appearance, and those which refer to his second coming.
Both periods are called "<i>the day of the Lord</i>;" and both
are ushered in by "darkness and gloominess." In both it
is said that "the sun shall be turned into darkness, and the
moon into blood;" and in both "the heavens and the earth"
are said to "pass away." In both of them the Lord is declared
to come "<i>in fire</i>," and the conclusion of both is "a
new heaven and a new earth."</p>

<p>Now <i>one</i> of these periods is past. The first Advent of
the Saviour to which the above prophecies refer, is accomplished.
And how were these predictions fulfilled? Did
the events <i>literally</i> take place? Let history answer. Though
the heavens and the earth were to be shaken and pass
away, yet no commotion took place in the visible parts of
<span class="pagenum">{32}</span>
nature. The seasons ran their wonted course; the sun
gave forth his usual light; and the earth pursued without
intermission her annual journey. Though the moon was
to be "turned into blood," yet no such disaster befell the
visible planet; her light shone as bright as ever. One solitary
meteor alone over the plains of Judea, announced to
the Eastern sages the coming of the Saviour. Though his
approach was to be <i>in fire</i>, yet no material flames accompanied
his Advent. The fire of Divine Love alone distinguished
Him. Not one of all these predictions had anything
resembling a literal accomplishment. And now let
us look to the conclusion. If, when two prophecies are
given, couched in the same language, one of which is fulfilled
while the other remains to be accomplished, the interpretation
of the second is to be judged of by the fulfillment
of the first, the following argument at once arises:
Since the prophecies relating to the first Advent of the
Saviour are expressed by the very same terms, and represented
by the very same images as those which refer to his
<i>second</i> coming, the meaning of these latter must be similar
to that of the others. And since not one of <i>those</i> prophecies
ever received a literal fulfillment, so neither are we to
expect a literal fulfillment of those before us. In a word,
since the events predicted at the Lord's <i>first</i> coming were
not natural, but representative images of spiritual things&mdash;of
states of the world and of the church; so those foreshadowing
his second coming are representative of similar
<span class="pagenum">{33}</span>
things, belonging to the minds of men, and will never receive
a <i>literal</i> accomplishment.</p>

<p>If, however, it be still maintained in opposition to this
remark, that they <i>must</i> be understood literally, I will ask
one question. Since the words of the <i>Old</i> Testament which
describe the first appearance of the Redeemer, are exactly
similar to those of the <i>New</i> which predict his second coming;
how is it that the former never received a literal fulfillment?
If it be replied, that this was figurative language,
while the latter is literal description; I again inquire, By
what authority or according to what rule is this distinction
made? Why is the first to be resolved into figure, while
the latter is considered as literally true? Such distinction
between the two cannot arise from the <i>language</i>; this is almost
word for word the same. It cannot be made because
the literal sense is in one case <i>reasonable</i>, while in the other
it is not; for in both cases it involves numerous absurdities.
It cannot be because the one is prophecy and the other narrative;
for both are the language of prophetic declaration.
On what authority, then, is the literal meaning of the first
<i>rejected</i>, while in the other it is retained and believed?
Why are not both to be understood alike, since in both the
descriptions are similar? There is no rule by which a distinction
can be drawn.</p>

<p>I have now gone over the first proposition, and have
proved that a literal interpretation of the passages adduced
involves absurdities as great as that of transubstantiation;
and that the absence of all literal fulfillment in the case of
<span class="pagenum">{34}</span>
other prophecies exactly similar, affords the strongest reason
to expect that in <i>this</i> instance no literal accomplishment
will take place. That the language itself is that of <i>correspondence</i>,&mdash;the
representation of spiritual things by natural;
and as such it will receive a spiritual and not a natural
fulfillment.</p>

<p>2. We now pass to the second point, namely that the
texts supposed to refer to the destruction of the material
world are inconsistent with each other; and are opposed to
other clear and express declarations of Scripture. In this
case as in the former, we shall note the words in the debated
texts. In the passages brought forward to support the
doctrine, there are four ways mentioned in which the destruction
of the heavens (or visible starry firmament) is
hereafter to take place. First, in one passage of the Revelation,
they are described as being "rolled away as a
scroll;" in another the stars are said to "fall from heaven
to the earth." In Peter's Epistle it is declared that they shall
"pass away with a great noise;" and in another place the
same apostle says that "the heavens being on fire shall be
dissolved." Now these four descriptions considered literally,
contradict and destroy each other. To dissolve is to
separate into particles, and to return to their first elements.
But if the starry heavens are <i>thus</i> to be destroyed, then
they can neither fall to the earth nor be rolled together as
a scroll; for that which is dissolved and reduced to its
first elements, can be destroyed no further except by annihilation.
And if the heavenly bodies are to be <i>thus</i> dissolved,
<span class="pagenum">{35}</span>
then no other kind of dissolution can affect them.
Again, if we take the other passage, "they were rolled
away as a scroll," we are placed in precisely the same dilemma.
By their being rolled away as a scroll, we must
then understand that they will be driven from their stations,
thrown into confusion, and hurried afar into the depths of
space. But if they are thus rolled away they cannot possibly
"fall to the earth," for the two events stand in direct
opposition; in the first instance they must be hurled into
space, far beyond the earth's orbit; in the latter they must
absolutely fall upon her surface. And now we ask, Are
the stars to be rolled away, or are they to fall upon the
earth? The literal sense of the Scripture mentions both
events; but if one occurs, the other (consistently with the
text) can never take place.</p>

<p>Suppose, however, we admit for the sake of argument,
that the rolling away of the heavens is an event separate
from the destruction of the stars. We again inquire
whether this event will take place <i>before</i> such destruction, or
<i>after</i> it. If <i>before</i> it, we come to the former conclusion; for
then the stars must fly off with the heaven in which they
are fixed. If <i>after</i> it, then, as there will be nothing but
<i>empty space</i> remaining, we ask how such empty space can
be called <i>the heavens</i>; and how empty <i>space</i> without a
single visible object, can be rolled away as a scroll!"
In this instance, therefore, if we abide by the literal sense
of one passage, we must of necessity reject that of the
others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{36}</span>
But it is further said that all these events are to take
place <i>previous</i> to the appearance of the Son of Man. "The
sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her
light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers
of the heavens shall be shaken. And then (immediately
following these events) shall appear the sign of the Son
of Man in heaven." Now this prior commotion includes
the dissolution of all the elements, "The heavens being on
fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with
fervent heat." Among the number of the elements, <i>the air</i>
will of course be destroyed, for it is included among them;
and with the air those <i>clouds</i> which depend upon it for their
existence and visibility. Yet, after this, when the clouds
have ceased to be, and when the heavens are no more, the
Son of Man is to appear in these very clouds and in the
midst of this heaven! Here, again, is an inconsistency in
the literal sense of the passage. If the heavens, and with
them the clouds are dissolved, then it is impossible that
anything can appear <i>in</i> what has ceased to have an existence.
Or if the Son of Man <i>is</i> to appear in the clouds,
then the heavens cannot be destroyed previous to that appearance.
Which way soever we turn we are met by a
difficulty. If we receive one of the passages in the literal
sense, we must either reject or spiritualize the other.</p>

<p>Again: at the time of our Lord's ascension, the two
angels who appeared to the disciples declared, "this same
Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall <i>so come
in like manner</i>, as ye have seen him go into heaven." Acts
<span class="pagenum">{37}</span>
i.&nbsp;11. It would therefore appear that, if these angelic messengers
are worthy of credit, the <i>descent</i> of our Lord is to
be exactly similar in circumstance to his ascent. Now, in
his ascension into heaven, there are several things which
require notice. 1st: It was <i>private</i>. He led his disciples
from the city to the Mount of Olives. 2d: It was seen
by none but his followers. The generality of the Jewish
nations did not even know that such an event had taken
place; they considered our Lord as a dead man; and
hence when they accused Paul before Festus, one part
of that accusation was that he affirmed one Jesus to be
alive, who was (in their opinion) dead. Acts xxv.&nbsp;19.
3d: His ascension was a <i>solitary</i> one. There is no account
whatever that any persons were <i>seen</i> ascending with Him:&mdash;"<i>He</i>
was taken up; and a cloud received <i>Him</i> out of their
sight." And, 4th: It was <i>unattended by any outward pomp</i>.
The Jews knew nothing of it;&mdash;there was no alteration in
the visible world; and even those who witnessed the event,
beheld nothing save a bright cloud into which he passed
and disappeared. The ascension of the Saviour was therefore
to the world a <i>private</i> occurrence, so far as privacy
consists in general ignorance respecting it. It was seen by
none but his disciples; it was without pomp or show. Of
those who afterwards heard of it, numbers gave no credit
to the story. And the only visible proof that it had taken
place, was the effect which followed&mdash;the extraordinary
out-pouring of the divine influence.</p>

<p>And if we keep to the literal sense of the words, <i>this</i> is
<span class="pagenum">{38}</span>
to be his descent from heaven: He is to come <i>in like manner</i>
as He went up. If, then, this be the case, then such descent
will be an occurrence unknown to the generality of
mankind, or only known by its following effects. It will be
unaccompanied by any destruction, and even by any commotion
in the realm of material nature. And many of
those who hear of it may be expected to deny it, according
to his own words: "When the Son of Man cometh shall
He find faith on the earth?"</p>

<p>Such, according to the passage before us must be the
manner of his Second Coming: but let us, if we can, reconcile
this with the former descriptions. In the one case
all nature is to be <i>destroyed</i>; in the other it is to remain
unshaken. In the former instance He is said to descend
with thousands of angels; in the latter, to come unattended.
By the first description, He is to be seen visibly by all; in
the second, He will be invisible to all except his followers.
The two accounts thus stand in direct contradiction to each
other. If He comes again in the same "manner" that He
ascended, then the former passages cannot be literally understood:
or if He comes literally in the manner they describe,
the passage before us cannot be true.</p>

<p>I might here, as in the former case, go through every passage,
and show that each of them contains within itself accounts
which are inconsistent with those of the others: in
one it is said that the Lord shall descend from heaven in
flaming fire: in another, in the clouds: in a third, on a
great white throne. In one it is declared that, before his
<span class="pagenum">{39}</span>
face the earth and the heaven shall flee away, and their
place be no more found: in a second, that <i>after</i> His coming
the departed shall rise from the earth, and the grave and
the sea give up their dead; consequently, if the latter part
be true, the earth will not pass away at the time of His descent.
In the whole there are inconsistencies which science,
according to the literal meaning, may disguise, but can
never reconcile.</p>

<p>We now turn to the consideration of other passages
which, taken even in their literal sense, militate strongly
against the doctrine in dispute. After the destruction of
the antediluvian earth by the flood, Jehovah affirmed, "I
will not <i>again curse the ground any more</i>, though the imagination
of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will
I again smite any more every living thing as I have done."
This <i>curse</i> which the Lord is here inferred to have pronounced
upon the former world, in whatever sense the
terms be taken, was accomplished in its destruction; and
the end of that world by a flood of waters, completed its
fulfillment. The curse of the Lord, therefore, when pronounced
upon the earth, leads to its dissolution. But God
Himself affirms that He will not thus curse the ground any
more,&mdash;that He will not again suffer it to be destroyed,
neither will He again smite everything living. The declaration
is absolute. It is not said that He will refrain
from it during a <i>limited period</i>, but that He will not do it
<i>any more</i>&mdash;to all eternity. Yet if the commonly received
doctrine be correct, this declaration of Jehovah must be
<span class="pagenum">{40}</span>
untrue. If <i>again</i> everything living <i>is</i> to be smitten,&mdash;if
again the earth is to be cursed with destruction as complete,
if not more so than the former one; then it cannot be true
that every living thing is <i>not</i> again to be smitten, nor the
earth again to be cursed. In this instance the literal proofs
clash with the solemn declaration of God.</p>

<p>If, however, it be objected that these words refer not so
much to the <i>destruction</i> of the globe, as to the <i>mode</i> of that
event, I reply that no such qualifying language is found in
the text. The words are general; they are not "I will not
again curse the earth <i>with water</i>," but I will not curse the
ground,&mdash;I will not destroy the earth "<i>any more</i>," either
in this way or in any other. "I will not smite any more
everything living as I have now done," by an universal
destruction. And, in fact, the promise that <i>a flood</i> should
no more destroy the world, would have afforded little consolation
to Noah, had he understood that another destruction
more awful than the former, was approaching, in which
not this world only, but the whole universe would perish;
and when not the greater part, but <i>all</i> things living, would
be destroyed, without the preservation even of a remnant.
The flood is certainly in the following chapter referred to
particularly as the more recent danger, and a repetition of
which would be most dreaded by the survivors; but the
very same declaration of Jehovah, which interdicts a flood
of waters, equally interdicts any other entire destruction:&mdash;"I
will not in any way curse the ground any more."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{41}</span>
There is another subject upon which I must touch, but
very briefly, since the arguments arising out of it might be
carried to a length far exceeding my prescribed limits.
The prophetic writings abound with descriptions of what is
called "the kingdom of David:"&mdash;a kingdom which was
to arise in the latter day, and upon which every blessing of
heaven was to descend. "In those days," says the prophet
Amos, "I will raise up the tabernacle of David that is
fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise
up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old." ix.
"And in the days of these kings (that is, literally, in the
latter times of the Roman power,) shall the God of heaven
set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed, and the
kingdom shall not be left to other people; but it shall break
in pieces, and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand
for ever." Dan. ii.&nbsp;44. Again, the same prophet: "I saw
in the night visions, and behold one like unto the Son of
Man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the
ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.
And there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom,
that all people, nations, and languages should serve
him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall
not pass away; and his kingdom, that which shall not be
destroyed." That these descriptions refer to the Redeemer,
is evident. Isaiah when predicting his approach, and the
establishment of his kingdom, says, "Of the increase of
his government and peace there shall be no end upon the
throne of David, and upon his kingdom to order it and to
<span class="pagenum">{42}</span>
establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth
even for ever." ix.&nbsp;7.</p>

<p>Now the question is, to what authority or kingdom do
these predictions refer? That it is not to the general government
of God, is clear,&mdash;this had existed from eternity; but
the dominion spoken of, was to commence at a definite period
of time,&mdash;"at that time," and "in the days of those kings."
The general subjection of all things to the Divine Being, is
also something arising out of his very nature, and is neither
given nor acquired; but this was something to be acquired.
"The Lord God shall <i>give</i> unto him the throne of his
father David:"&mdash;"The saints of the Most High shall take
the kingdom." Nor can it refer to the kingdom of the
just in glory, for the descriptions are such as can only apply
to the state of men on earth. "He shall feed his flock
like a shepherd; He shall gather the lambs with His arm,
and carry them in His bosom." Isa. xl.&nbsp;11. "I will set
up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even
my servant David." If, therefore, this kingdom be neither
the general dominion over all, nor the state of the righteous
in eternity, it can only relate to the kingdom of the
church on earth. And that it does so, is plain from the
very terms used. David is, by almost all professed Christians,
acknowledged to have been a type and representative
of the Messiah; and the Jewish nation over whom he reigned,
most certainly prefigured the Christian church: the throne
of David is therefore the authority of the Lord in his
church on earth, and his kingdom is that church itself.
<span class="pagenum">{43}</span>
Now this kingdom and this throne,&mdash;this church and authority
<i>are everlasting</i>; they shall "never be destroyed;"
they shall "not pass away;" they shall "stand for ever."
But if <i>the earth</i> on which this church exists, is hereafter to
dissolve and pass away, the kingdom must pass away with
it. For though it is true that the just in heaven would
still constitute a kingdom of the Lord, yet that kingdom
would no longer be "<i>the kingdom of David</i>." The very
declaration that the kingdom of the Lord <i>on earth</i> will
<i>never be destroyed</i>, supposes as a necessary consequence, that
the earth on which it is erected will also continue to exist.</p>

<p>In agreement with this are the words heard by John;
"There were great voices in heaven, saying, the kingdoms
<i>of this world</i> are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of
his Christ, and He shall reign for <i>ever and ever</i>." Rev. xi.&nbsp;15.
And over what is He thus to reign? Most certainly
over the kingdoms which He is here said to have obtained&mdash;the
kingdoms of <i>this world</i>; and over these He is to reign
"for ever and ever." But how is He to reign for ever over
the kingdoms of the world, if the world and its kingdoms
are to be destroyed? Whenever the earth is dissolved, the
kingdoms of the world will be no more; and he cannot
reign over that which has no existence! If, then, the
world and its kingdoms are to be destroyed, He can never
reign <i>for ever</i> over them: or if He will thus reign for ever
over the kingdoms of the world, then those kingdoms must
exist for ever; and if the <i>kingdoms</i> exist for ever, <i>the world</i>
on which they are founded must exist for ever with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{44}</span>
And exactly in accordance with this assertion are the
words of the Psalmist: "He (the Lord) built his sanctuary
in high places, like <i>the earth</i> which He hath established <i>for
ever</i>." And those of Solomon:&mdash;"One generation passeth
away, and another cometh, <i>but the earth abideth for ever</i>."
The same is declared of the heavens: "His name shall endure
<i>for ever</i>; His name shall be continued <i>as long as the
sun</i>." Psalm lxxii.&nbsp;17. "His seed shall endure <i>for ever</i>,
and his throne <i>as the sun</i> before me; it shall be <i>established
for ever as the moon</i>, and as a faithful witness in heaven."
lxxxix.&nbsp;36.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more directly opposed to the common
opinion than these explicit declarations of the Bible. It is
certain that these passages refer to the visible earth and to
the material heaven; and these it is expressly declared are
to continue not for a limited time, but for ever: while in
the passages adduced to prove the opposite, we are left to
struggle among difficulties, without any certainty that the
visible earth is at all intended, since even those commentators
who believe the tenet are compelled, in most instances,
to abandon the proofs of it.</p>

<p>I have now established, as far as is necessary, my second
proposition. I have shown that the literal sense of the
passages brought forward to confirm the doctrine of the
earth's destruction, are inconsistent with each other, as well
as with other parts of the Sacred Volume; and therefore,
that such literal meaning cannot be the true one. I have
shown that the words of Jehovah assert that the world
<span class="pagenum">{45}</span>
shall not be smitten any more. I have further shown that
the duration of the kingdom of God, runs parallel with
that of the visible world, and that therefore both must endure
for ever. And lastly, that the sacred writers declare
in explicit language the endless duration both of the earth
and the heavens.</p>

<p>3. I now proceed to consider the third part of the subject:
that the passages brought forward, when taken in
their proper connexion, give no countenance to the popular
doctrine, but on the contrary, afford evident proofs that
they have no reference to it. In doing this, I shall adduce
them one by one in the order they are laid down. And
first, the passage in the Gospel of Matthew: "Immediately
after the tribulation of those days the sun shall be darkened,
and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall
fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be
shaken. And then shall appear the sign of the Son of
Man coming in the clouds of heaven; and then shall all
the tribes of the earth mourn when they see the Son of Man
coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great
glory."</p>

<p>I have already noticed the inconsistencies which arise
from adopting the literal meaning of the passage; and I
now remark further, that in their literal and obvious application,
the words refer not to any destruction of the
world in general, but to the approaching overthrow of the
Jewish nation and polity. I admit that they have a spiritual
reference to the state of the Christian church of which
<span class="pagenum">{46}</span>
the Jews were a type; but of this we shall speak hereafter.
It is with the literal meaning we have now to do, since on
the literal meaning the doctrine is founded.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_5" id="Ref_5" href="#Foot_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Our Lord had been addressing the multitude in the temple;
and in that address He had solemnly warned them of
their approaching danger. On his departure, his followers
pointed to its stately and magnificent buildings; and He
again seized the opportunity to repeat to them the prediction
of its final destruction. Naturally anxious to learn
the fate of their country, and, perhaps, too uneasy on their
own account, they came to Him privately and asked,
"When shall these things be?" and "what shall be the
sign of thy coming, and of the consummation of the
age?"<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_6" id="Ref_6" href="#Foot_6">[6]</a></span>
&mdash;that is, the period of the Jewish government and
religion. In reply, He delivered the splendid prophecy
before us; first warning them against those pretenders to
Messiahship, who, soon after His ascension, overrun the
land of Judea; and then going on to describe the miseries
which were coming upon the Jews, and the final overthrow
of their temple and city;&mdash;He delivers to them this prediction,
not in the common language of narrative, but, in
the magnificent figures of the ancient prophecy. A method
of speaking which, while it pointed out the mutation of
earthly things, had a further reference to things spiritual.
And thus while He pointed out the overthrow of the Jewish
power, He referred likewise to the degraded state and
<span class="pagenum">{47}</span>
corruption of the Christian church,&mdash;the spiritual Jerusalem,&mdash;when,
having lost its love or charity, it sunk down
into a state of formal observance as lifeless as the departed
spirit of Judaism.</p>

<p>In neither of these senses, however, does the passage
point to any destruction of the visible universe. If we
take it in its outward reference to the Jewish nation, then
the darkening of the sun and the withdrawing of the moon,
together with the other parts of the description, can only
be representative images of their multiplied distresses.
This view of the subject is taken by most of those who
have commented on the words. "The sun shall be darkened,"
"that is, (says one,) all their glory and excellency
shall be eclipsed; all their wealth and prosperity shall be
laid waste;&mdash;the whole government, civil and ecclesiastical,
shall be destroyed; and such marks of misery found upon
them, as never were seen upon a people."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_7" id="Ref_7" href="#Foot_7">[7]</a></span>
But among the believers of the tenet in dispute, we presume there is
not one more highly celebrated for learning than Dr. Adam
Clarke; yet he, in commenting upon this passage, gives up
all idea of a literal destruction. The following is the doctor's
explanation:</p>

<p>"Immediately after the tribulation."&mdash;Commentators
generally understand this and what follows, of the end of
the world and Christ's coming to judgment. But the word
<i>immediately</i> shows that our Lord is not speaking of any
distant event, but of something immediately consequent on
<span class="pagenum">{48}</span>
calamities already predicted; and that must be the destruction
of Jerusalem. The <i>Jewish heaven</i> shall perish and
<i>the sun</i> and <i>moon</i> of its glory and happiness shall be
darkened,&mdash;brought to nothing. <i>The sun is the religion of
the church; the moon the government of the state</i>; and <i>the
stars</i> are the <i>judges and doctors of both</i>. In the prophetic
language, great commotions upon earth are often represented
under the notion of commotions and changes in the
heavens. The fall of Babylon is thus represented by the
constellations of heaven withdrawing their light, and the
sun and the moon being darkened:&mdash;the destruction of
Egypt by the heaven being covered, the sun enveloped with
a cloud, and the moon withholding her light: the destruction
of the Jews by Antiochus Epiphanes, is represented
by <i>casting down some of the host of heaven</i> and <i>the stars</i> to
the ground. And this very destruction of Jerusalem is
represented by the prophet Joel, by showing wonders in
heaven and in earth,&mdash;<i>darkening the sun, and turning the
moon into blood</i>. This general mode of describing these
judgments, leaves no room to doubt the propriety of its application
in the present case." (<i>Commentary on Matthew.</i>)</p>

<p>Thus, in the hands of one of the most learned advocates of
the doctrine, does one of its principal proofs vanish into air.
According to his showing, there is nothing in the whole passage
referring at all either to the material earth, or the
visible heavens; and the whole is a figurative account of
the overthrow of the religion and government of the
Jews,&mdash;"the <i>sun</i> and <i>moon</i> of the <i>Jewish heaven</i>." We
<span class="pagenum">{49}</span>
might follow the doctor through the whole chapter, and
show that in almost every point he confirms what has been
formerly advanced. "The sign of the Son of Man was,
(he says,) the signal manifestation of Christ's power and
glory," in the destruction of Jerusalem. The "angels sent
forth to gather the elect, the apostles and their successors
in the Christian ministry." The sound of a trumpet, "the
earnest affectionate call of the Gospel:" and "<i>the elect</i>,"
"the Gentiles who were now chosen or elected, in place of
the rebellious obstinate Jews." In the same manner he
explains the whole of this and the following chapter; and
in the latter declares that the whole of the accounts up to
the thirty-first verse, may be properly applied to the destruction
of Jerusalem. And here we may leave him; for
if there is nothing from the first verse of the twenty-fourth
chapter, to the thirty-first verse of the twenty-fifth, which
relates to the destruction of the world, surely nothing respecting
it will be found in the remainder.</p>

<p>Thus does this passage, so often brought forward to add
to the terror of the world's dissolution, which has been
sounded forth from pulpits and re-echoed from the press,
when calmly examined, prove to have no connexion with
the subject: but to refer to an event as different from the
general conflagration, as light from darkness.</p>

<p>But some may be ready to say, "Although it has not
this reference in its outward meaning, yet you have already
confessed that it relates to Christianity and the church;
and is not the doctrine contained in this internal application?"
<span class="pagenum">{50}</span>
I answer, no! The doctrine only stands upon the
supposition that the heavens and the earth referred to in
the passage, are the literal and visible portions of nature.
We have seen that in its relation to the Jews, no such
things are intended; still less, therefore, can it point to
these in its <i>internal</i> meaning. As the sun and moon in the
literal application are, (to use the words of Dr. Clarke,)
"the sun and moon of the <i>Jewish</i> heaven" or state, so in
spiritual reference, they are the sun and moon of the <i>Christian</i>
heaven, or state of the church; and, as pointing to
spiritual principles and spiritual states, have nothing to do
with the outward machinery of nature. As no destruction
of the world, then, can be found in the <i>internal</i> sense of the
prophecy, it is confessed, even by the advocates of the doctrine,
that there is nothing respecting it in the <i>outward</i>
sense. And if nothing is found relating to it either in the
<i>spiritual</i> or <i>literal</i> meaning of the words, then it is not there
<i>at all</i>; and the passage as a proof of the dissolution of all
things, must be abandoned for ever.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_8" id="Ref_8" href="#Foot_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>The next passage which claims attention, is that in the
sixth chapter of the Revelation; for the words in the first
chapter being those of the apostle previous to his prophetic
visions, may be classed among the apostolic passages of
which we shall speak hereafter. The text before us reads:
"And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and lo,
there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black
<span class="pagenum">{51}</span>
as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood, and
the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig-tree
casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a
mighty wind: and the heaven departed as a scroll when it
is rolled together, and every mountain and island were
moved out of their places." In this part of the subject I
say nothing of the evidently figurative nature of the passage,
nor of the absurdities before alluded to, as existing in
the sense of the letter; but I shall make one remark obvious
to the minds of all, and borne out by the connexion
of the words themselves. The vision of the <i>seals</i> (as well
as that of the vials,) is one continued prophecy, which is
not concluded until the breaking of the seventh seal in the
eighth chapter. Now the events above described, whether
representative or literal, happen under the <i>sixth</i> seal; yet
the descriptions of the <i>seventh</i> as well as those of the others,
refer to events which were to occur in the church and on
this visible earth. The sealing of the hundred and forty-four
thousand,&mdash;the prohibition of the wind to blow on
the earth,&mdash;the seven trumpets and their consequences,
evidently relate to states of the church in this world; yet
all these things which were to be transacted in the visible
world, happen <i>after</i> the description above quoted.</p>

<p>If, then, various and multiplied events are described as
occurring <i>on the earth, after</i> the heavens had departed like
a scroll, and the islands were moved out of their places,
nothing can be more clear than that the destruction of the
earth is not here alluded to; for if the world is to be destroyed
<span class="pagenum">{52}</span>
under the <i>sixth</i> seal, then no events can happen
<i>upon it</i> under the <i>seventh</i>, since it will then have no existence;
but as such events <i>are</i> described as passing <i>in the
world</i> under the <i>seventh</i> seal, then that world cannot previously
be destroyed under the <i>sixth</i> seal.</p>

<p>And in this opinion we are, as before, supported by the
advocates of the doctrine themselves. The sealing of the
tribes is almost universally acknowledged to signify the
preservation of the church, under those heavy and forthcoming
calamities represented by the effects of the seven
trumpets. And as this preservation, and these calamities,
occur <i>after</i> the darkening of the sun, and the falling of the
stars, the latter event is generally supposed to prefigure (not
the destruction of visible nature, but) some great change
in the political or religious constitution of the world. The
precise period to which this change is to be referred, has,
however, divided the opinions of the learned. Some apply
it altogether to the Jews, and suppose that their destruction
in Judea and at Jerusalem was so dismal that it was represented
to John as the darkening of the sun, and the moon
looking like blood, and the stars falling. Others apply it
to the overthrow of Paganism and the destruction of the
heathen emperors; and accordingly by the earth quaking,&mdash;the
sun becoming black,&mdash;the moon becoming blood, and
the stars falling from heaven to earth, is to be understood
the great changes that were made in the Roman empire by
the overturning of the Pagan state. Others again apply it
to "the great and horrible confusion of the Christian world
<span class="pagenum">{53}</span>
under Antichrist, when Christ the Sun of Righteousness
began to be obscured; that is, his doctrine darkened,&mdash;the
moon or church turned into blood,&mdash;the stars or pastors
fallen from heavenly offices, the Scriptures, like the
heavens rolled up, forbidden to be read, the mountains,
(king and princes) in jeopardy,&mdash;and the islands brought
under Antichrist's yoke and tyranny." Very few venture
to apply it to what is commonly called the "end of the
world;" and none can do it without charging the apostle
with inconsistency, by affirming that it shall take place at
a definite period of time; and then speaking of events that
are to occur in the world <i>after</i> that time, that is, after the
world shall have been destroyed!</p>

<p>On this passage the commentator whom we have already
quoted observes,</p>

<p>"A great earthquake," that is, "a most stupendous change
in the civil and religious constitution of the world." "The
<i>sun</i>"&mdash;the ancient Pagan government of the Roman empire,
"<i>was totally darkened</i>; and like a black hair sackcloth,
was degraded and humbled to the dust. The <i>moon</i>&mdash;the
ecclesiastical state of the same empire, <i>become as blood</i>, was
totally ruined; their sacred rites abrogated; their priests
and religious institutions desecrated; their altars cast down;
their temples destroyed, or turned into places of Christian
worship. The <i>stars of heaven</i>&mdash;the gods and goddesses,
demi-gods and deified heroes, of their poetical and <i>mythological
heaven</i>, prostrated indiscriminately, and lay as useless
as the figs or fruit of a tree shaken down before ripe by a
<span class="pagenum">{54}</span>
tempestuous wind. <i>And the heaven departed as a scroll.</i>
The whole system of Pagan and idolatrous worship, with
all its spiritual, secular, and superstitious influence, blasted,
shriveled up, and rendered null and void as a parchment
scroll when exposed to the action of a strong fire. And
every mountain&mdash;all the props, supports, and dependencies
of the empire; whether regal allies, tributary kings, dependent
colonies, or mercenary troops, were all moved out
of their places, so as to stand no longer in the same relation
to that empire and its worship, support, and maintenance,
as they formerly did. And <i>island</i>:&mdash;The heathen
temples, with their precincts and inclosures, cut off from
the common people, may be here represented by <i>islands</i>."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_9" id="Ref_9" href="#Foot_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Like the former passage, therefore, this is rendered nugatory
as a proof of the dissolution of the universe; and
rendered so, too, by the admission of its friends. As that
referred to the <i>Jewish heaven</i> which passed away at the destruction
of the city of Jerusalem, so this is affirmed to
apply to the <i>mythological heaven</i> of the Pagans, which was
dissolved at the conversion of Constantine to Christianity;
and to have no allusion to the system of material nature.
Here are two of the strongest passages thrown aside as useless
in the controversy; and we shall quickly perceive that,
when closely examined, the advocates of the doctrine
equally cast off, if not the whole, at least the greater part,
of the remainder.</p>

<p>Indeed, as I have already remarked, the connexion of
<span class="pagenum">{55}</span>
the passage is such as will by no means admit of any literal
burning of the earth; so that, even though its inapplicability
to the subject had <i>not</i> been allowed, yet would the
inconsistency attendant on such a meaning, have pleaded
loudly for its rejection.</p>

<p>We pass now to consider the next proof, which occurs in
the twentieth chapter of the same book: "And I saw a
great white throne and Him that sat on it, from whose face
the earth and the heaven fled away, and there was found no
place for them. And I saw the dead small and great stand
before God; and the books were opened," etc. In connection
with this stands the first verse of the twenty-first chapter:
"And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the
first heaven and the first earth were passed away, and there
was no more sea."</p>

<p>Upon this passage we may repeat the remark which we
applied to the foregoing: that the events which follow
this descent of the Saviour, and which are stated as its consequences,
are such as apply only to the church of God on
earth; and that, therefore, the words before us cannot
point to any dissolution of the universe. The immediate
effects of the passing away of the heaven and the earth,
are the formation of a new heaven and a new earth, and
the descent of "the holy city New Jerusalem." This latter
event the celebrated Dr. Hammond declares cannot refer to
the state of glorified saints in heaven, but must signify
some peculiar benefit bestowed upon the church on earth.
The expression "descending out of heaven from God," at
<span class="pagenum">{56}</span>
once determines its reference to a state of things below;
and it no doubt relates to the restoration of Christianity to
its primitive purity. In the very same manner does Dr.
Clarke explain the passage, though he evidently betrays a
wish to find within it a proof of the dissolution of all
things. "The New Jerusalem," says he, "doubtless means
the Christian church in a state of great prosperity and purity:"
and alluding to the description given of her, he observes,
that "it has been <i>most injudiciously</i> applied to <i>heaven</i>."
If, then, the consequence of the passing away of the first
heaven is to usher in (not eternal glory, but) a prosperous
state of the church on earth, it must follow in course that
such a passing away of the heavens must refer to a change
and alteration in the church, and not in the natural world;&mdash;to
the conclusion and departure of a state of darkness,
and the commencement of a new state of light and affection.
As the former <i>Jewish heaven</i> of types and shadows departed
at the first coming of the <span class="smcap">Son of God</span>, and as the <i>mythological
heaven of Paganism</i> was "shriveled up" at the triumph
of the Gospel, so must the <i>modern Christian heaven</i>
of ignorance and evil pass away at the Second Coming of
the <span class="smcap">Son of Man</span>; and to it will succeed a <i>new heaven</i> of
purity and peace.</p>

<p>In this application of the passage, we are supported by
the explanation of the above commentators. They agree
in defining heaven and earth figuratively, to mean the state
of the world and of the church;&mdash;of the Jewish world,
when applied to the Jews;&mdash;of the Pagan world, when applied
<span class="pagenum">{57}</span>
to the Heathen: and by the self-same mode of interpretation,
we are justified in applying it to the <i>Christian
world</i> in its reference to Christians. In no case can it be
explained of the visible world of matter; for the passages
being acknowledged to be figurative, it must, as in the other
instances, bear the figurative meaning.</p>

<p>Having thus noticed the only two texts in the Revelations,
which seem, in the least, to bear upon the subject, I
may be allowed again to repeat my surprise, that persons
should be found attempting to support a doctrine by the
literal sense of this book. Those among the advocates of
the popular belief, who have most carefully studied the
prophecy, protest their ignorance of its meaning and application.
"I cannot pretend to explain the book," says the
writer above quoted; "I do not understand it. I repeat it,
I do not understand the book; and I am satisfied, that not
one who has written on the subject, knows anything more
of it than myself."&mdash;"What the prophecies mean, and
when and <i>how</i> they are to be fulfilled, God in heaven alone
knows." It "is termed a <i>Revelation</i>; but it is a revelation
of <i>symbols</i>;&mdash;an exhibition of <i>enigmas</i>, to which no particular
solution is given; and to which God alone can give
the solution." "To pretend to say, (observes Calmet,) what
this new heaven and new earth mean, and what are their
ornaments and qualities, is, in my opinion, the greatest of
all presumptions." Yet, into this presumption do the generality
of Christians fall, who, amidst this candid confession
of learned ignorance, bring forth with the greatest
<span class="pagenum">{58}</span>
confidence the literal sense of the book, to support a doctrine
which length of time has seemed to render sacred.</p>

<p>The words of the apostles now demand our attention;
and with respect to these we notice a fact which is necessary
to the proper understanding of their ideas; that is,
that the apostles were themselves ignorant both of the time
when, and the manner how, the second coming of the Lord
would be accomplished; and that they have, therefore,
when speaking upon this subject, carefully abstained from
giving any opinion of their own, confining themselves entirely
to the words of the Saviour, or paraphrasing them
without altering the symbolic images.</p>

<p>This circumstance in no degree detracts from that extraordinary
illumination with which the apostles were endowed.
They were men raised up by God, and filled with
the Divine influence, in order that they might propagate
in the world, and among all nations, the religion of Christ;
but it does not appear that among the supernatural gifts
which they received, the gift of <i>prophecy</i> was included,
except in the case of the apostle John. Yet, even if we
allow, for the sake of argument, that they did <i>possess</i> this
gift, it would by no means follow that they perfectly understood
their own predictions. It is the peculiar nature of
prophecy, that its proper meaning is not known until the
time of its fulfillment; and this was especially the case with
the Jewish writers who foretold the first advent of the Saviour.
Although their predictions seem now so clear and
strong, yet both the prophets themselves and their followers,
<span class="pagenum">{59}</span>
were at the time ignorant of their precise meaning; and
hence arose the absurd notions which the Jews entertained of
a temporal salvation and an earthly Saviour. The gift of
prophecy was, therefore, except in very rare instances, accompanied
by entire ignorance of the manner of its fulfillment.
It does not, however, appear that this gift was bestowed
in general upon the apostles; their knowledge of
the second coming of the Saviour was derived entirely
from the words of the Saviour; and of the express meaning
of these words, as referring to a future event, they
were completely ignorant. In quoting his prediction they,
therefore, seem to have held a persuasion that this second
coming was very speedily to be accomplished. Thus they
speak of the "day of the Lord" as "at hand,"&mdash;of "the
Judge standing at the door:" and Paul, in particular,
seems to have believed that some of the Christians of that
day, if not himself among them, would live to see its
approach.</p>

<p>Whether this latter opinion be true or not, certain it is
that the words of the apostles had such an effect upon the
first Christians, that they were in momentary expectation
of the appearance of the Lord. During the first nine
centuries after his ascension, a general idea prevailed that
his second coming would speedily take place; and when,
after waiting nine hundred years, they found their expectations
disappointed, they still looked to the one thousandth
year to usher in this great event; and so powerfully did
this opinion operate upon the world, that rich and poor
<span class="pagenum">{60}</span>
flocked in great numbers to the Holy Land, there to await
his appearance. The wealthy sold their possessions, or
gave them away to charitable institutions; kings quitted
their thrones, and subjects their employment, under the impression
that "the end of all things was at hand," and
that the world was of no further value. Such, then, was
the effect of a misapplication of prophetic language; and
though nearly nineteen hundred years have gone by, yet
are the Christian churches still following in the steps of
their predecessors, holding the literal sense of the Word in
defiance of reason, and looking for the Lord's personal
appearance in the clouds of heaven, though common sense
proclaims its improbability.</p>

<p>But to return. From a comparison of the descriptions
of the apostles with the predictions of the Lord, it is easy
to perceive whence they quoted. In many instances the
two accounts are almost word for word the same; in others
they are enlarged; but in none is the connexion of events,
or the prophetic symbols, disturbed. "The day of the
Lord (says Peter,) shall come as a <i>thief in the night</i>, in
which the heavens shall <i>pass away</i> with a great noise."
Here it is easy to perceive whence the words of the apostle
were drawn; for we have only to compare them with those
of our Lord, to be convinced that it was from these the description
is taken. "Heaven and earth (says the Saviour)
shall <i>pass away</i>, but my words shall not pass away."
"Know this, that if the good man of the house had known
at what hour <i>the thief</i> would come, he would have watched,
<span class="pagenum">{61}</span>
and not have suffered his house to be broken through."
Again, Paul declares, "The Lord Himself shall descend
from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the <i>archangel</i>
and <i>the trump</i> of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise
first." Here, too, the prophecy is quoted from the Saviour's
declaration: "He shall send his angels with a <i>great
sound</i> of a <i>trumpet</i>, and they shall gather together his elect
from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the
other." Once more the Apostle John says: "Behold, he
cometh <i>with clouds</i>; and every eye shall <i>see</i> him, even they
that pierced Him; and all <i>the tribes of the earth</i> shall wail
because of Him:" where the allusion is to these words:
"Then shall appear the sign of the coming of the Son of
Man in <i>heaven</i>; and then shall all the <i>tribes of the earth
mourn</i>, when they <i>see</i> the Son of Man <i>coming in the clouds</i>
of heaven, with power and great glory." "Behold, (says
the Lord) I <i>stand at the door</i> and knock;" "Behold,"
says the apostle, echoing the Saviour's words, "the Judge
<i>standeth at the door</i>."</p>

<p>It would exceed my present limits to enter fully into this
subject. Suffice to say, that in most passages the reference
to our Lord's predictions may be plainly discerned; and in
all the prophetic representatives are retained: The sun,&mdash;the
moon,&mdash;the stars,&mdash;the earth,&mdash;the heavens, darkness,
dissolution, and fire&mdash;the very images which are used by the
Saviour, are likewise used by the apostles, and used, too, with
a reference to the <i>same period</i>&mdash;the last days of the Christian
church. If these images, when used by the prophets
<span class="pagenum">{62}</span>
and by the Redeemer, are figurative, then, as the same
<i>images</i> applied to the <i>same period</i>, they are figurative when
employed by the apostles. Or, if the dissolution and burning
of the earth described by the latter are literal facts,
then the burning of the earth and its dissolution described
by the former, are literal facts likewise; for the <i>same images</i>
applied to the <i>same period</i>, must have the <i>same meaning</i>.</p>

<p>If, then, these observations be correct, and I see not how
they can be fairly controverted;&mdash;if the apostles did not,
except in one instance, possess the power of foretelling
future events, and if their descriptions of the second coming
of the Lord are gathered from his own words, or from
the prophetic writings, then we must judge of their meaning
by that of the prophecies whence they are derived.
This is a plain and self-evident conclusion. If I quote the
words of any writer, the meaning of the quotation must be
gathered from the works of that writer; and more especially
if I quote for a similar purpose, and profess myself
one of his disciples and admirers. The passages,
therefore, which occur in the apostolic writings, are by no
means decisive proofs of the doctrine in debate. As quotations
and paraphrases of the Lord's words and those of the
prophets, they must, by every rule of fair criticism, have a
similar meaning. We have seen that the former are, by
the acknowledgment of the most learned writers, figurative
and correspondent; the just inference therefore is, that
the latter, as quotations and paraphrases of them, must be
figurative also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{63}</span>
4. The last part of our proposition comes now before us,
namely: that the doctrine of the destruction of the universe
is opposed to the end of creation, and to the character of
God as a Being of unbounded love and infinite wisdom.
I may here be told of the tendency of matter to dissolution;
of its mutability and constant change; of the elements
of destruction which nature herself engenders; and
of all those by which reason and science have sought to
gloss over the popular tenet. But the <i>mutability</i> of nature
is no proof of final dissolution. <i>Mutability</i> is liability to
change, or a continual tendency to remove from one state
to another. Whatever is changeable, or whatever can experience
alteration, is, therefore, mutable. But this mutability
attaches not to material nature alone, but to all creation;
the highest archangel in the highest heaven, as well
as every spirit embodied on earth, is a mutable creature.
The state of glory in the eternal world, as well as the state
of man below, is a state of <i>mutability</i>,&mdash;a state in which
there are continual changes either for the better or the worse.
This will appear plain if we consider that, whatever is immutable
cannot be acted upon by any higher power; for the
action of such a superior cause supposes a corresponding
<i>effect</i> and that effect supposes a <i>change</i> in the object acted
upon, in one way or another; and, consequently, any object
upon which an effect can be produced, must be a mutable or
changeable object. Now, in the case of angelic beings, God,
the First Cause of their existence, is continually acting upon
them by his love and wisdom, and thus raising them eternally
<span class="pagenum">{64}</span>
in the scale of blessedness: such alteration of their state
from glory to glory is a change,&mdash;an effect produced upon
them by an Almighty Cause; and this effect is at once a
proof that angels themselves are <i>mutable</i> creatures, or liable
to change. The same may be said of the state of blessedness;
it is continually receiving fresh supplies of glory from the
Fountain of life, and is thus <i>changing</i>&mdash;becoming more and
more blessed: and it equally applies to the spirit of man.
This, like the mind, is never "at one stay;" nor, perhaps,
does the state of the mind remain precisely the same for
two hours together. The angels of heaven, the state of
the blessed, the spirit of man, are all changeable. God
is the <i>only immutable Being</i>; for He alone cannot be
acted upon or changed by any higher power; and hence it
is one of his exclusive prerogatives to be "without variableness
or shadow of turning." If, then, the angelic hosts,
as well as heaven itself, are mutable, while yet they endure
for ever, the mutability of nature is no proof at all that
she, any more than the former, is approaching dissolution.</p>

<p>"Nature herself," as one well observes, "effects her renovation
from her decay." Matter, though decomposed and
subjected to ten thousand changes, loses none of its essential
properties; but continually assuming new forms, gives
variety to the world, without being at all altered from its
original nature. Indeed, it has been strongly asserted that
there has not been a particle of matter lost from the creation
to the present moment; changed every particle may
have been, but still there is not one wanting; and if this
<span class="pagenum">{65}</span>
be the case, such continual change is no proof of approaching
destruction.</p>

<p>We are accustomed to look upon God as a Being of infinite
Love; and, perhaps, at this stage of the subject it
may be well to inquire, what motive induced the Lord first
to create the visible universe; and what was the end proposed
in its creation. In the breast of the Divine Being
there could exist but one motive from which creation could
spring; and this was Love. But the Love of God being
infinite, could only have respect to an eternal work; hence
the end of creation was to make as many beings as possible
happy, and this to all eternity. In order to accomplish
this, infinite <i>Love</i> clothing or embodying itself in <i>wisdom</i>,
made the worlds. According to the words of the apostle,
"By the Word (or the wisdom of God,) were the heavens
made;" intending these as the habitations of rational
beings, who after having passed through a short state of
probation, might finally enter upon a spiritual state and
enjoy perfect happiness. The wisdom of God, being the
manifestation of his love, in completing this work, arranged
everything in the most perfect order; and accordingly
every part of the universe is formed in the manner best fitted
to promote the end of its existence,&mdash;the everlasting happiness
of man. In our own world, where evil has produced
a corresponding change in outward things, even that change
itself is good, since, while it reminds man of his corruption,
it leads him to seek a better habitation.</p>

<p>Thus far our assertions are easy of proof. <span class="smcap">God Is Love</span>;&mdash;not
<span class="pagenum">{66}</span>
merely <i>loving</i>, but <span class="smcap">Love</span>, the Spring and Fountain
of all derived existence. And love, even in its derivative
form in the bosom of man, is an active passion, continually
seeking for objects on whom to bestow its affection.
As is the stream, then, so is the fountain: God being Love
in its Infinite Essence, must ever have sought to form creatures
capable of being rendered eternally happy; and hence
the motive that led to creation. But <i>love</i> always manifests
itself in the understanding or thought; and by the thought
is brought into outward action. It is the thought or wisdom
of man in which his love first takes a definite form;
this serves it for a guide, and directs its operations: and so
again is it with the Being in whose "image" we are formed.
The manifestation of infinite Love, is infinite Wisdom; and
this brings the power into outward act: by infinite Wisdom,
therefore, as the acting form of infinite Love, were
rational beings and their varied habitations created. But
this perfect wisdom can never produce anything unlike itself;
for, as is the <i>cause</i>, so is the <i>effect</i>; hence the frame of
nature which that wisdom calls into being, must be like
itself, the most perfect and complete that could possibly
exist. The <i>motive</i>, therefore, which led to creation was
<i>Love</i>; its <i>cause</i>, Wisdom; its <i>end</i>, continued and eternal
happiness.</p>

<p>And further, as the love and wisdom of God once operated
in bringing the universe into existence, so from that
period have they been unceasingly employed in preserving
the creatures which they formed; for, as the <i>end</i> of creation
<span class="pagenum">{67}</span>
was the "bringing of many souls into glory," so, to
the present, has that end been answered by the constant
exercise of the Divine protection over the universe of
matter and its rational inhabitants; that the one might
continue a fit habitation for the creatures of God; and that
by the constant procreation of the human race, a succession
of men might be brought into being as candidates for
everlasting glory. But the expected dissolution of the universe,
and the end of human succession, will at once put a
stop to this infinite design. If, after a certain number of
persons have been born into the world, the procreation of
man must end, then the purpose of creation cannot be <i>infinite</i>;
for that which has reference to a certain number
and a definite period of time, is not an <i>infinite</i> purpose;
and that which is not an infinite purpose, is not the off-spring
of <i>infinite love</i>. Or, if the purpose of God in creation
<i>did</i> spring from infinite love, then it must be an infinite
purpose; and if the purpose of creation be infinite,
then it is not bounded by a few thousand years, nor will it
end with a few generations.</p>

<p>Nor is the popular doctrine more consistent with the
character of God than with the infinity of his designs.
We have seen that <i>love</i> was the cause of the world's creation;
but what motive, I ask, can lead to its destruction?
There is nothing in the Almighty contrary to love; therefore,
if it is destroyed at all, <i>love</i> must be still the motive.
But love never works except for the good of its creatures;
therefore, if the universe is dissolved, it must be because
<span class="pagenum">{68}</span>
such dissolution will confer a benefit upon mankind. And
the question then arises: What benefit can mankind derive
from the destruction of this material world? The answer
of some will be ready. "The world" they tell us, "has
been changed by sin, and it will be dissolved in order that
it may be restored to its pristine glory and beauty;&mdash;that a
new heaven and a new earth may spring from its ashes."
But does the change here supposed in the constitution of
the world, require its dissolution? When sin entered into
the universe, and the mind of man was contaminated, an
immediate and corresponding effect was produced upon the
world of matter; but the production of that effect was not
accompanied by a <i>dissolution</i> of the material system; it
operated surely indeed, but slowly, and without any outward
destruction. Why, then, should not the change from
evil to good, be effected in like manner as the change from
good to evil? When the earth is "filled with the knowledge
of the Lord,"&mdash;when all shall experimentally "know
Him from the least even unto the greatest,"&mdash;when man is
again restored to his former state of peace and purity, a
corresponding change must once more take place in his material
habitation; but that change requires no destruction
of the world to effect it. Similar causes produce similar
effects; and as a change in man from good to evil, produced
an alteration in the system of the world, but without
any dissolution, so a change in the souls of men from
evil to good, must likewise produce an alteration in the
earth, but without dissolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{69}</span>
But this destruction, it is said, is to usher in "a new
heaven and new earth." We are, therefore, justified in
asking, for what purpose is this new material system created?
Since it is believed that the succession of man will cease
with <i>this</i> earth, why should <i>another</i> earth be formed? Is
another race of men to be created? This, the strongest
advocates of the doctrine do not even suppose. Is it, then,
to be the habitation of the righteous of the present earth?
This, it cannot be, for the bodies of the departed will no
longer be material, but <i>spiritual</i>; and to assert that a
<i>spiritual</i> substance can dwell and walk on a material earth,
however pure that earth may be, is to assert what every one
sees to be preposterous. Since, then, it will not suit the departed
righteous, and another race is not to be formed, why,
we continue to ask, will this new earth be created? Here
we are left completely in the dark; nor amidst all the reasoning
of the advocates of the popular doctrine, can we find
a single clue to direct us to an answer.</p>

<p>And here the former inquiry properly comes in. Since
there is nothing in the nature of God contrary to <i>love</i>, and
since that love only works for the temporal or everlasting
benefit of man, what motive can induce the Almighty to
destroy this visible universe? We have seen that the state
of mankind in time will not be improved by it; for a
change in the constitution of the earth has been already,
and may again be, effected without it: and, besides, whenever
such an event takes place, time and the temporal existence
of man will be no more: and the eternal happiness
<span class="pagenum">{70}</span>
of the blessed can in no degree be increased by an overthrow
of material nature; for when the spirit has left this
sphere, it has done with matter, and no longer depends upon
it for its feelings or its pleasures. If, then, such a dissolution
of the earth as Christians in general look for, will
neither benefit mankind in time nor in eternity, then it is
contrary to the character of God that He should bring such
an event to pass; for He never operates unless to effect
some benevolent purpose; and this will effect none, either
here or hereafter.</p>

<p>The same reasons which induced the Almighty to call
the universe into existence, will therefore induce Him to
continue its existence. The desire which He felt to make
as many rational beings as possible happy, led to creation.
The same feeling has preserved the world in existence to
the present moment. And as God is unchangeable, that
desire must operate as powerfully ten thousand ages hence,
as it does now; and the operation of that desire must, as a
necessary consequence, lead to the preservation of this
earth, from which a succession of rational creatures is to
spring. If, then, at a future period the world is destroyed,
and the multiplication of the human race ceases, it must
be either because the Lord is unable to save more, or is
unwilling to do it. The first supposition is impious, and
the other supposes a change in the Almighty; for then
that desire which led to creation must have ceased to exist
in the Divine bosom; the infinite love of God must have
ceased to operate; and of consequence, the Lord Himself
<span class="pagenum">{71}</span>
must have changed both his desires and his operations.
The destruction of the world is, therefore, opposed to the
character of God, as a Being of infinite Love and unbounded
power.</p>

<p>We may now sum up the arguments which have been
adduced.</p>

<p>1. When the literal sense of a passage of Scripture is
opposed to common sense and reason, such literal sense
must be laid aside, as not containing the true meaning.
But the literal sense of those passages which speak of a
destruction of the earth, is both absurd and unreasonable.
Therefore the literal sense of these passages must be abandoned,
and does not contain the proper interpretation.
Again: when two prophecies are found couched in the
same language, and referring to a similar event, one of
which is fulfilled while the other remains unaccomplished;
the manner in which the latter will be fulfilled, must be
judged of by the previous fulfillment of the former. But
the first prophecies relating to the first coming of the Lord,
are exactly similar to those which refer to His second
coming; yet they never were <i>literally</i> fulfilled: therefore
we have no just reason to look for a literal fulfillment of
the latter. 2. When any text of Scripture is, in the letter,
inconsistent with itself, or with other plain and express
passages of the Word, the interpretation must be sought
for in the spiritual meaning of the words. But the proofs
of this earth's destruction are inconsistent with themselves,
and are opposed to other plain and direct portions of the
<span class="pagenum">{72}</span>
Word of God; therefore the meaning of those alleged
proofs must be found, not in the literal sense, but in their
spirit. 3. In the explanation of every part of the Sacred
Scriptures, a due regard must be had to the connexion in
which it stands; and any mode of explanation which tends
to break such connexion, or is at variance with it, may be
beautiful but cannot be <i>true</i>. But the connexion in which
the passages referred to are found, is completely at variance
with the doctrine derived from them; nor can they in any
way support that doctrine until severed from this connexion.
Therefore that explanation which the generality of Christians
gives them, cannot be correct. 4. And, lastly, whatever
doctrine is opposed to the character of God, as a God of
unbounded love and infinite wisdom, is not a doctrine of
the Bible. But the doctrine before us is thus opposed
both to his nature and perfections; therefore it cannot be
true.</p>

<p>The arguments arising out of these propositions might
be carried to a great extent. If, however, they have been
supported by reason as well as Scripture,&mdash;if we have no
right to expect a literal fulfillment of the prophecy relating
to the Lord's second coming; and if the literal sense
of the passages must be abandoned; then we have no reason
to look for an overthrow of the universe, and the improbability
of such a destruction has been fairly established.</p>

<p>Having thus gone through the principal part of the subject,
and having shown that the common interpretation,
against which so many and serious objections lie, cannot be
<span class="pagenum">{73}</span>
the true meaning; I proceed, as a necessary conclusion, to
notice briefly the spiritual meaning of the prophetic symbols
used in the passages that we have noticed, and their
connexion with each other. That the whole of these passages
relate to the Christian church, we have already stated;
and that they are of importance to us, may be fairly
inferred from their being found in the Sacred Volume. It
is, therefore, scarcely possible to conceive that even learned
and pious men have been able to perceive nothing within
them but earthly concerns,&mdash;mere temporal events; the
destruction of Jerusalem; the conversion (whether real or
pretended) of Constantine; wars in Italy; the irruption
of the Goths; and the famine of the Antonines; as if these
events were either able, or likely, to give that saving wisdom
which it is the object of God by his Word to bestow.
Everything in the Sacred Volume is intended to contribute
to our salvation; but transactions like these do not tend
to make us wiser or better. It is to the Christian church,
and to its principles and practice, therefore, that these
descriptions refer; and as they relate to the general body,
they apply to every individual of which that body is composed,
and thus demand our most serious attention.</p>

<p>The principal symbol used in these prophecies is, "the
sun;" and this is said to "become black," and to be "turned
into darkness." Our first inquiry, therefore, is, what principle
in the spiritual world of Christianity, corresponds
with this luminary in the world of matter. And in this
inquiry we shall be aided, if we consider the functions it
<span class="pagenum">{74}</span>
performs. The sun is the source of all natural heat and
splendor; and without his influence, the worlds in the
solar system, now glowing in light and beauty, would
be dead and unattractive masses of matter. He is the
cause of all vegetable and animal life: deprived of his
beams, vegetation would decay, and the animal kingdom
sink in death. He is the principal agent in the production
of sight; the eye without him, would be a useless organ.
In a word, if we were called upon to name the most important
agent in the material world, our thoughts would turn
at once to the sun. Now, in the spiritual world, including
both the church of God and the individual spirit of man,
what is that which produces the same effects as the natural
sun does in the system of matter? What is the source of
love and wisdom, spiritual heat and spiritual light?&mdash;What
is it that produces in the mind those fruits of righteousness
which are the characteristics of true religion? What gives
to reason (the eye of the mind) its power of discerning spiritual
things? and invests the soul, naturally dark and lifeless,
with spiritual life and glory? It is Divine Love that
does this. This is the Sun of the spiritual universe,&mdash;the
Fountain of all heavenly light and life,&mdash;the Cause of
every good word and work. And in giving this meaning
to the natural image, we are supported throughout by the
Sacred Scripture. The Lord is called "the Sun," and,
"the Sun of Righteousness." He is said to <i>rise</i> upon the
mind, when the spirit turns itself toward Him; and to
<i>turn away</i> from man, when he departs from his Maker. In
<span class="pagenum">{75}</span>
the same manner, whenever the prophets or apostles were
favored with a visible representation of the Divine Majesty,
they describe the face of God as shining like <i>the sun</i>.
Now the face of God is his Love. Hence the Psalmist says,
"Lift upon us <i>the light of thy countenance</i>, and cause thy
face to shine upon us." And this love of God is described
as the sun, rising, shining, and giving light. Thus, too, in
the visions of John, when the apostle beheld an image of
the pure church of Christ, he describes her as "a woman
<i>clothed with the sun</i>;" or encompassed on every side by the
Divine Love. By the sun, then, in the internal sense of
prophecy, we understand the infinite and unbounded love
of the Almighty, which alone is the cause of life and light;
and which gives strength, support, and beauty, to the spiritual
system of man.</p>

<p>Having obtained the meaning of this principal symbol,
we shall be at no loss to determine that of the other.
"<i>The moon</i>," as regards apparent splendor, is the second
great luminary in the visible heavens. In herself, however,
she is a dark body, and possesses no power of communicating
light except by the reflection of the sun's beams.
In this case, therefore, we have to seek a second principle
in the heaven of the church, corresponding with this second
light in the heaven of matter; a principle which, though
it enlightens and cheers the soul, has no brightness in itself;
but derives all its usefulness and beauty from a conjunction
with <span class="smcap">LOVE</span>. And this principle we find in <span class="smcap">FAITH</span>; that
faith which springs from charity. As the moon derives all
<span class="pagenum">{76}</span>
her light from the sun, so does true faith draw all its glory
from love. As the moon separated from the sun's influence,
is dark and lifeless, so is faith without love, dead and useless.
And as the light proceeding from the moon is but
the rays of the sun reflected from her surface, so is the
faith that springs from a modification of the love of God,
a reflection of his infinite benevolence.</p>

<p>And here, again, the apostle confirms this idea. While
he represents the church of God as being <i>clothed with the
Sun</i>, he also describes her as standing upon the moon, or
having "the moon under her feet:"&mdash;pointing out the love
with which she is continually encompassed, and the faith
upon which she is securely founded. Thus Paul, speaking
of the universal church of Christ, declares that it is
"built upon the <i>foundation</i> of the apostles and prophets:"&mdash;that
is, upon their doctrines, and upon the truth which
they made known; "Jesus Christ Himself," as <span class="smcap">the Truth</span>
Itself, being "the chief corner stone." Eph. ii.&nbsp;20. With
this, too, agrees the sublime prophecy of Isaiah. When
speaking of the church restored to its full perfection and
glory, he says, "<i>Thy sun</i> shall no more go down, neither
shall thy <i>moon</i> withdraw herself; for <span class="smcap">Jehovah</span> shall be
thine <span class="smcap">Everlasting Light</span> and the days of thy mourning
shall be ended." ix.&nbsp;20. That is: Thy love shall no more
depart, neither shall thy faith and charity decay; for God
shall dwell in every soul by his love, and his beams shall
be reflected from every bosom.</p>

<p>We might go through the whole of those predictions
<span class="pagenum">{77}</span>
which relate to this subject; and in all cases we should
find that this interpretation of the figures not only makes
a complete and consistent sense, but that the passages so interpreted
would stand in the most complete agreement with
the general tenor of the Scriptures, and with the hopes of
the best and wisest among men.</p>

<p>The third symbolic figure is, "the stars:" and these, as
regards the quantity of light transmitted to the earth, are
secondary luminaries in the visible system. They shine not
with any borrowed radiance, but with their own native
splendor. And here, again, we must repeat the inquiry,
what are those luminaries in the <i>mental heaven</i>, which hold
a secondary place in the concern of salvation, to love and
faith; yet shine, not with reflected light, but with the real
brightness of the Divine Glory? The answer is easy: They
are the doctrines of religion or the <i>knowledges</i> of truth;&mdash;those
portions of the eternal reason, which <span class="smcap">the manifested
Truth</span> has Himself revealed. But some may be ready to
observe, that these are already included in the Faith of
which I have just spoken. A single remark, however, will
obviate this objection. That <span class="smcap">FAITH</span> and the <i>knowledge of
truth</i> generally go together, is certainly true,&mdash;even as the
moon and stars shine at the same time. But to <i>know</i>
the truth is one thing, and to have faith in God is another
and widely different thing; as different as the light of the
stars is from that of the moon. And as the stars frequently
shine when the moon is not seen, so does the knowledge of
truth frequently exist in the mind when true faith has no
<span class="pagenum">{78}</span>
existence. I am, therefore, consistent in declaring that the
<i>light</i> of the stars,&mdash;the knowledge of doctrines, though a
valuable acquisition, is secondary in importance both to
Christian <i>faith</i> and to Divine <i>Love</i>. Yet the doctrines or
truths which are the objects of this knowledge, are not derived
from any source lower than divinity itself; they are,
as just observed, portions of eternal wisdom designed for
the guidance of the church of God; and derived from the
"Father of lights," from whom proceeds "every good and
every perfect gift."</p>

<p>In thus mentioning <i>doctrines</i>, (or the term which I have
used as synonymous, <i>truths</i>, for pure doctrines are but truths
embodied) I by no means refer to the tenets of a sect or
party, but to the eternal wisdom of the Almighty, as revealed
in his word: and with respect to this, the parallel
between it and the natural image may be carried through
all its parts. As the stars are of the same nature with the
sun, and like him shine with their native and proper light,
so is the wisdom of God of the same nature with his love;
both being essential attributes of Divinity. As the stars,
however, though in themselves splendid bodies, communicate
no heat to the earth, and are but of secondary importance
in comparison with the sun and moon, so does the
mere knowledge of truths, (although the truths in themselves
possess the nature of divinity,) leave the soul as
cold and lifeless as before; and is of far less importance in
the spiritual system than the love of God, or faith, its reflection
on the soul. Carry the comparison as far as we
<span class="pagenum">{79}</span>
may, still the stars of the natural heaven correspond exactly
to the <i>truths</i> of the church; and the light which they
emit, to the <i>knowledge</i> of that truth.</p>

<p>And this interpretation of the symbol agrees, too, with
the vision of the apostle. The church clothed with the Sun
of love, and standing upon faith; the symbolic <i>moon</i> had
upon her head (the seat of intelligence and wisdom) a
crown of twelve <i>stars</i>;&mdash;denoting the knowledges of pure
truth which should ornament that church in her last state
of peace and holiness. So the great red dragon, who is described
as fighting with Michael and his angels, is said to
have drawn the third part of the stars from heaven;&mdash;pointing
out the almost total extinction of real truth in the
corrupted Christian churches. We might again trace this
meaning in every passage where the natural image occurs,
and we should still find that the sense it gives to each of
them is consistent both with the Word of God, as referring
to the great concern of salvation, and with the connexion
in which the passages are found.</p>

<p>In these symbolic representations we, therefore, perceive
the three sources of light in the Christian heaven, love,
faith, and knowledge. The first being the diffused affection
of the Father of spirits; the second, its reflection in
the soul of man; the third, the truths of doctrine which
enliven and ornament the church, proceeding immediately
from the Source of all Wisdom. The glory of each is the
same in substance, as the light of the sun, moon, and stars,
is the same in nature; but it differs in degree, as the luminary
<span class="pagenum">{80}</span>
whence it springs is of more or less importance to the
eternal happiness of man. Knowledge is the least important;
of itself merely, it produces nothing. Faith rises
above knowledge; yet even faith by itself is useless. Love
is the chief; this quickens, animates, and renders fruitful,
the church of God, and the soul of each individual member.</p>

<p>I press this interpretation on no one; yet I may say,
without breaking the bounds of Christian liberty, that it carries
probability on its very face. The parallel between the
natural image and its spiritual correspondent, is complete
throughout; but this can by no means be said of the various
constructions which have generally been put upon
them. The sun, it is said, is the civil government of a
state; and the moon, its ecclesiastical policy. But in vain
shall we attempt to draw a comparison here between the
natural figure and the object said to be signified by it.
The civil government of an empire is not the source of all
wisdom, love, and prosperity, as the sun is of heat, light,
and fruitfulness. It does not give to the ecclesiastical all
its power, glory, and beauty, as the sun does to the moon;
nor would the church become dead and lifeless if separated
from the state, as the moon would if severed from the sun.
The pastors of the church, which it is affirmed are the
stars, do not, like the stars, shine with their own native
splendor. The comparison, therefore, does not in any degree
hold good: while in the meaning we have given above,
consistency both with Scripture and reason, as well as with
the best interests of man, is preserved throughout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{81}</span>
Now if this signification of the sun, moon, and stars, be
correct, we need not employ much time in fixing the meaning
of the terms "heaven," and "earth," when applied to
the church of God. <i>Heaven</i>, or the atmosphere, is that in
which the sun, moon, and stars appear; and by means
of which they produce their effects. It is the grand reservoir
of those particles, which, acted upon by the sun, and
thus set in motion, cause heat; and preserve on the earth,
life and vegetation. And the earth is that body, on the surface
of which vegetation flourishes and life appears. This
at once points out the figures as applying to the <i>inward feelings</i>
and <i>outward life</i> of an <i>individual</i>; or, to the internal
state of the church and its outward forms and ceremonies.
It is in what the apostle calls "the inward man," that <i>love</i>,
<i>faith</i>, and <i>knowledge</i> produce their first effects; and by
operating upon the feelings and affections of the mind,
cause spiritual light and heat&mdash;true wisdom and divine
love. And these produce a corresponding effect in the outward
conduct, bringing forth "fruits meet for repentance,"&mdash;the
living forms and witnesses of religion. As the sun
shines in the atmosphere and produces fruit on the earth,
so love shines in the soul and brings forth effects in the
conduct, either in the case of an individual, or of the
church as an assembly of individuals. By the same rule
of analogy we may perceive what is meant by <i>the clouds</i>.
These in the natural world, are vapors exhaled from the
earth by the heat of the sun; and which condensed into
form in the atmosphere, serve to perform their important
<span class="pagenum">{82}</span>
functions. They temper and lessen in some degree the
heat of the sun; they serve to beautify the appearance of
the heavens; they are the great depository of rain, and
the principal agents in the production of tempests. That
which corresponds to them must, therefore, be something
springing from the outward state of man, which is the
grand depository of truth (spiritual water), behind which
the glory of the Divine Love and Wisdom is seen, and
which accommodates this wisdom to the capacity of mankind.
And this we find in the outward letter of the Word
of God. The historical narratives, the figures of prophecy,
the parables of the Saviour, are all images rising from the
world and the temporal state of mankind; and thus, like
the <i>clouds</i>, they have their origin from the earth. Within
this outward body of image and narrative are contained
the treasures of wisdom and knowledge; it is the grand
source from which truth must be drawn. And the glory
of God shines through the whole, imparting to every
natural form the splendor of divinity. And as the material
images of the Bible serve to accommodate the wisdom
of God to the capacity of his creatures, so have they often
been the cause of those convulsions in the church, which
seemed even to threaten her existence. "The <i>letter</i>" has
often killed, when unaccompanied in the mind with the
"<i>spirit</i> which giveth life." We cannot, therefore, find in
the figure before us anything which so completely accords
with its origin and design, as the outward letter of the
Word of God&mdash;the clouds of the Christian heaven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{83}</span>
The meaning of the principal symbols being thus stated,
we pass to the connexion which they bear to each other in
the predictions of the Saviour. We have already noted
that the prophecy contained in Matthew, and recorded by
the other Evangelists, refers in its primary application to
the destruction of Jerusalem by the Roman armies; but in
its more extensive meaning it points to the state of the
Christian church in her period of decline and corruption,
of which Jerusalem in her last days was a fitting type.
With respect to this it is declared "<i>the sun</i> shall be darkened"&mdash;the
Divine Love obscured and lost; "and the
moon shall not give her light"&mdash;faith and charity shall
sink in darkness; "and the stars"&mdash;the knowledge of truth
"shall fall from heaven,"&mdash;no longer exist in the minds
of her members; "and the powers of heaven"&mdash;the whole
internal state of the church "shall be shaken"&mdash;shall be
thrown into complete disorder and confusion. This meaning,
to which we are led by the connexion and correspondence
of the natural symbols, points to a time (not when the
universe shall be destroyed, but) when true religion shall
have ceased to exist in the church:&mdash;"when the love of
many shall wax cold:" when true faith will no longer be
found; and when knowledge&mdash;the knowledge of genuine
spiritual truth&mdash;shall have passed away. The same things
are described in the vision of the apostle. "There was a
great earthquake"&mdash;a shaking and disorder in the state of
the church; "and the sun became black as sackcloth of
hair, and the moon became as blood, and the stars of heaven
<span class="pagenum">{84}</span>
fell to the earth,"&mdash;the knowledge of truth which once
shone in the <i>mind</i>, sunk into mere outward <i>creeds</i> and confessions
of faith; "and the heaven departed as a scroll
when it is rolled together"&mdash;the whole internal state of the
church was thrown into confusion, and every inward feeling
of religion perished.</p>

<p>The event immediately following is the appearance of the
Son of Man in the clouds, with a trumpet; and since it is
confessed that a trumpet signifies "the call of the Gospel,"
or as I would express it, the manifestation of truth; and
as the <i>clouds</i> correspond to the <i>outward form</i> of the Word,
the appearance of the Lord in the clouds and attended by
trumpets, must signify the manifestation of spiritual love
and truth in the letter of Scripture: and this is supported
by what is afterwards said to be the consequence; "a new
heaven and a new earth,"&mdash;a new state of the church both
internal and external, both as regards inward feelings and
outward conduct.</p>

<p>That this interpretation is true, I call upon no one to
believe; but that it is probable will, I think, be confessed
by all; and that it is in perfect harmony with the infinite
designs of God toward his rational creatures, as well as with
his character as a Being of infinite Love, will be equally
acknowledged. Whether there has been a period in the
Christian church (as there certainly was in the Jewish)
when the above description was applicable to her; when
religion had sunk into mere formality; when bigotry and
intolerance both in priests and people, cut up charity by
<span class="pagenum">{85}</span>
the roots; when faith was a mere body from which the
spirit had departed; when the clergy were mere formalists,
and the people were sensualized; when sacred knowledge
was neglected by the one and unknown to the other:
whether, I say, such a period <i>has</i> yet arrived, and if so,
whether it was <i>eighty</i> years ago, or eight hundred, it is not
my province now to inquire. My object is to show that
the images used by the sacred penmen have reference to
such a state, and to a subsequent restoration; and this I
have shown by the rule or law of analogy existing between
spiritual and natural things, as well as by the grand
design of the Word of God in which those images occur.</p>

<p>And if it be probable that such is really the fact, then
the design with which I commenced my task is completed.
If the natural sense of the words of Scripture is absurd&mdash;if
the best commentators themselves admit that in their
outward application the words have no reference to the destruction
of the natural world&mdash;and if, considered in their
internal meaning, they relate to the church, its decline,
and restoration; then there is no proof in the Scriptures of
the dissolution of the visible universe; but strong evidence
that it will never take place.</p>

<p>Let us, however, before leaving the subject, take a hasty
glance at the two doctrines which have been presented.
The first declares that after creating the universe, and endowing
it with life and beauty; after forming man as a
candidate for eternal glory, and after raising up a church
which it is said was to endure "for ever," God will at a
<span class="pagenum">{86}</span>
future time (for what reason, or to answer what purpose, is
unknown,) destroy the fabric he has created; throw the
whole universe into confusion and reduce it to ashes. That
He will, for some reason equally unknown, put an end to
the human race, and no more bring rational creatures to
eternal happiness; that heaven will be closed, and not
another candidate admitted; and that the church will then
cease on earth, and never again be restored. And this
supposition is founded on vague and mysterious texts of
Scripture, and on a literal interpretation of figures which
the most learned confess they cannot comprehend.</p>

<p>The other doctrine maintains that God, having created
the world and peopled it with inhabitants, will continue
it in existence; and that though religion will in the
"latter ages" decline, yet at length "the Lord will appear
in the brightness of his glory," will destroy evil and false-hood
among men,&mdash;restore the world to its first state of
purity; and that it shall then for ever become one vast
temple, from which a ceaseless song of praise shall continually
arise; while its inhabitants, prepared and preparing
for a higher state, shall pass in succession into the eternal
rest of God; and that the earth shall therefore be a
nursery for glory,&mdash;a place of trial for a continual race of
candidates for heaven.</p>

<p>This is a consummation worthy of the Creator,&mdash;worthy
of the infinity of his nature and perfections,&mdash;worthy of
the plan of redemption which He became incarnate to
effect. It is agreeable to the dictates of the soundest
<span class="pagenum">{87}</span>
reason, and in accordance with the hopes and wishes of
every man who has not bowed down his reason to the idol
of popular opinion. While the opposite tenet sets reason
at defiance, makes the Bible teach what is practically
absurd, and stands in opposition to the opinion of some of
the most learned among its own advocates.</p>

<p>We cannot conclude this little treatise more appropriately
than in the words of a writer often quoted in these pages.</p>

<p>"The doctrines or principles which I have stated and
defended in this work, I believe to be the truths of God.
Those against which I have argued, I believe to be either
false or unproved. The doctrine which cannot stand the
test of rational investigation, cannot be true. We have
gone too far when we have said 'such and such doctrines
should not be subjected to rational investigation, being doctrines
of pure revelation.' I know no such doctrine in the
Bible. The doctrines of the Scripture are doctrines of
<i>eternal reason</i>; and they are revealed because they <i>are such</i>.
Human reason could not have found them out; but when
revealed, reason can both apprehend and comprehend them.
It sees their perfect harmony among themselves, their agreement
with the perfections of the Divine Nature, and their
sovereign suitableness to the nature and state of man: thus
reason approves and applauds. Some men cannot reason,
and therefore they declaim against reason, and proscribe it
in the examination of religious truth."</p>

<p>Men may incorporate their doctrines in <i>creeds</i>, or articles
of faith, and sing them in <i>hymns</i>; and this may be both
<span class="pagenum">{88}</span>
useful and edifying if the doctrines be <i>true</i>. But in every
question which involves the eternal interests of man, the
<i>Holy Scriptures</i> must be appealed to in union with <i>reason</i>
their great commentator. He who forms his <i>creed</i> or <i>confession
of faith</i> without these, may believe anything or
nothing, as the cunning of others or his own caprice may
dictate. Human creeds and confessions have been often
put in the place of the Bible, to the dishonor both of revelation
and reason. Let <i>those</i> go away, let these be retained,
whatever be the consequence.</p>

Dr. Clarke has a very curious note on this passage. He supposes
that the "noise" will be occasioned by the action of electric fire, on
the watery particles of the atmosphere. These, being divided into
their two component <i>gases</i>, the one will ascend into the higher regions,
and the other float on the earth's surface. Thus, he says, the
account of the apostle is "philosophically correct." Whether this
be the <i>apostle</i>, or whether such account is correct in any degree, let

replaced by its opposite, and more resembles
a religious meeting than the juicy entertainment
intended. The 'Few Friends'
describes some twenty pastimes, all more
or less intellectual, all provident of mirth,
requiring no preparation, and capable of
enlisting the largest or passing off with the
smallest numbers. The description is conveyed
by examples that are themselves
'as good as a play.' The book deserves
a wide circulation, as it is the missionary

<p class="review">"<i>Words in Season</i> is the title of a

Walton College, Liverpool. 12mo. Cloth. $1.50.</p>

<p class="review">"Appears to be to demonstrate that
Christ actually descended into hell after
death: that the time intervening between
his death and his resurrection was spent
there not in preaching to the lost spirits,
but in actually suffering their punishment:
and that this actual and literal suffering
of the 'second death' was necessary
to complete the atonement and to make
him a true and sufficient substitute for
sinners. We shall not attempt to follow
the elaborate argument by which the
author endeavors to sustain this most
extraordinary position.... Giving to
the author credit for very considerable
research and no little ingenuity in the
construction of his argument, we must,
nevertheless, rank his book as among
the 'curiosities of literature.'"&mdash;<i>N.Y.

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily

distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no

  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
